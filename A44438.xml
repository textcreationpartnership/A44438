            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>AN old Friend and Acquaintance of the very Reverend Author of the following Sermons and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſes, in honour of his Name and Memory, (though he accepteth no Man's Perſon, neither can give flattering Titles) ſaith, upon the occaſion of their being Printed and Publiſhed, as followeth, <hi>viz.</hi> That there have been Three Volumes of Sermons and Diſcourſes ſent forth into
<pb facs="tcp:109965:4"/>
the Publick before theſe have appeared, and not any one of them unprefaced to; but in none of theſe Prefaces hath he met with any thing to convey down the just Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of this our great Man, and his Manner, and Miniſtry to Poſterity; He will make an Experiment therefore, if any thing may be ſaid (he ſaith not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) for, hitherto, nothing hath been ſaid) to render the account of this Amiable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſeful Labours amongst us to after Ages, beſides the Teſtimony of his Gifts and Graces in his Books, ſo fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar amongst us; for by theſe, though he be dead, he yet ſpeaketh; his Works praiſe him in the Gates, and his Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance ſhall be bleſſed. Many will bear Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the Name of our Author was not unknown, but celebrated in this our great City, in its Suburbs, in our Lines of Communication, and within our Bills of Mortality, when he for ſeveral Years li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and laboured with great acceptance and ſucceſs in theſe places: Ask in the Town and Pariſh of <hi>Hackney,</hi> how much Good was done by Mr. <hi>Hopkins</hi>'s Lectures, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially amongſt the richer ſort of Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, and the younger ſort at the Schools there, and eſpecially thoſe that were deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb facs="tcp:109965:4"/>
from good Families. If you believe me not, ask from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to <hi>Illyricum;</hi> from <hi>Oxon</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Exon,</hi> if you pleaſe, from one <hi>London</hi> to another, even unto <hi>London-derry</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> where was his Top-preferment, and I have been aſſured his laſt Works were more than the firſt: <hi>So that we have found him that faithful and wiſe Servant his Lord had made Ruler over his Houſhold, to give them their Meat in due ſeaſon.</hi> Indeed, by his exalted Name, I ever took him to be none of our ſmaller Prophets, nor of the <hi>Patres minorum Gentium:</hi> In his firſt education, and at his firſt appearance in the Grammar-School, he ſoon ſignalized himſelf, none of his Age and Stature being well able to keep pace with him; at his coming unto the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, it was by times taken notice of his Stock of Grammar, and all good Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, eſpecially in the learned Languages, and his Studies and Manners were ſuch that he rendred himſelf in the College both much a Scholar and much a Gentleman, and was choſen out from amongſt others to Inſtruction and Government therein, and particularly the Inſtruction and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſome of ſeveral Young Gentlemen,
<pb facs="tcp:109965:5"/>
and ſome deſcended from ſome of our No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and moſt Honourable Families in our Kingdom and Nation. In the Churches of Chriſt, unto the Service whereof he was never ſlack, when invited, and called, his very Firſt-fruits were promiſing, and his Firſt-fruits being holy, the Lump was alſo holy. The Crouds in <hi>Hackney</hi>-Church, in St. <hi>Mary Woolnoth Lombard-ſtreet,</hi> at <hi>Exon,</hi> at <hi>Dublin,</hi> at <hi>Raphoe,</hi> at <hi>London-derry,</hi> and laſt at St. <hi>Mary Aldermanbury</hi> in our own City, declare him a Maſter-workman, <hi>the Preacher that was wiſe, and that ſought out accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able words:</hi> And his Words were as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable as they were acceptable. By the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the Four Volumes of Sermons, you will be able to do more than make a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, you will take ſome Meaſures of his Parts, and the diſpoſition of his Mind, of his Studies and Miniſterial Endeavours, with the bleſſed Seals which were put there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
                  <p>I will only further (as to my part here) in his Honour, commend to your peruſal, in ſpecial, this Fourth Volume of his Sermons and Diſcourſes: The Contents will give you the Account of what Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials
<pb facs="tcp:109965:5"/>
they conſiſt, and to what <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſes and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements they were directed and applied. But I further take liberty to ſay, Here are, in theſe Diſcourſes now handled by him, both the <hi>Commoda</hi> and the <hi>Accommoda,</hi> things profitable in themſelves, and ſeaſonable to our preſent Times and Debates, <hi>Verba ſuper Rotas,</hi> ſome of the Author's Golden Apples in Pictures of Silver: They ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver knew our Author, that knew him not to be as acute and ſolid in his Polemick Diſcourſes, as he was accurate and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent in his Practical and Ordinary Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons. And let but the Chriſtian Reader take the firſt Diſcourſe in this Book, on <hi>Phil. 2.12, 13.</hi> and read but with due Caution and Obſervation, and he will ſoon think there will not need more be ſaid to ſtay and quiet the Minds of Men on the controverted Points of Liberty, or the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Nature, and the Intereſts of the Grace of God in our Salvation. He hath alſo happily herein taken up the Queſtion, and proved Repentance and Faith are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prejudicial to the free Grace of God and the Father, nor in any-wiſe dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory unto the Merits of Jeſus his Son: As alſo fully proved we are far from being juſtified as ſoon as elected or redeemed. In
<pb facs="tcp:109965:6"/>
the Second Part, he hath happily added and proved, that a temperament of the fear of a Just and Sin-revenging God, is conſiſtent with, and neceſſary to be joined unto our highest Attainments in the joyful Senſe of the Love and Favour of God, and the fullest Aſſurances of Heaven and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation we have in this Life, and hath here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in cut the Sinews of the <hi>Antinomian</hi> Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, on the contrary part, and without any Noiſe or Clamour. In the Third Part, you will find and be much pleaſed with, and, I hope, equally benefited by his very Pious and Plain Treatiſe of the Nature and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of Conſcience, the rather becauſe the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions and Defilements of it being ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly opened, and what it is, and of what Importance to get and to keep a clear Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, with many neceſſary Directions and Helps in order thereunto, very proper to the Times wherein ſo many have made Shipwrack of Faith, and of a Good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. The next Diſcourſe is of Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Conſtancy in Holy Prayer, not only as a <hi>Negotium cum Deo,</hi> but Heaven in ordinary and perfect Hearts-eaſe, whil'st we are here upon Earth. And the last is an elaborate, though ſhort Exercitation and Treatiſe of the Divine Omnipreſence, a
<pb facs="tcp:109965:6"/>
Meditation prepared to render all the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Parts of the Book more beneficial to us, no Argument being in its own Nature more awakening and awful to an intelligent and diligent Reader. The rest you are beholden to Providence, and the Pen of a ready Writer for; but what is written, was unqueſtionably ſpoken, and with a great <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, by a very Reverend Prelate, now in that Kingdom, (a great Admirer, Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lower, and dear Brother of ours, deceaſed) in the Cloſe of his excellent Sermon, Preached in St. <hi>Mary Aldermanbury</hi>-Church, upon <hi>Coloſſ. 3.1, 2, 3, 4,</hi> Verſes, <hi>June 24. 1690.</hi> in the Cloſe whereof, having Chriſt's and our Reſurrection he proceeds, ſaying,</p>
                  <p>This was the Doctrin of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and the Faith of the Primitive Chriſtians: And that this Faith did animate them againſt the Fears of Death, and enable them to meet that King of Terrors with Undaunted Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions; and it is this which ſtill Buoys up the ſinking Spirits of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; it was this which comforted this Reverend and Learned Prelate, whoſe Funerals was then ſolemnized. This ſupported him in his late Troubles and Afflictions, in his greateſt Pains and
<pb facs="tcp:109965:7"/>
ſharpeſt Agonies. He often diſcourſed with me on this Subject. He fixed his Thoughts upon the Glorious Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and ſet his Affections on the things above; and with the Joyful Hope and Expectation of them he was enabled to bear the Torments of his Body with great Patience, and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Magnanimity; and was not in the leaſt terrified with the Thoughts of Death. It was not <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> to him; he ſpoke of it without Concern, and triumphed over all its Terrors, and welcomed it as a Joyful Meſſenger, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him to his Dormitory till the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection. And he died full of this Faith, and did, with <hi>Job,</hi> ſay, Though his Body were deſtroyed with Worms, it ſhould riſe again to a Bleſſed Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, and in the ſame Fleſh he ſhould ſee God; and through the Merits and Interceſſion of Chriſt, he doubted not to Partake of the Things above.</p>
                  <p>But you expect I ſhould ſay more of him; and, indeed, he highly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves it, and much, very much, is due to the Memory of ſuch an excellent Prelate; who, for Learning and Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb facs="tcp:109965:7"/>
for Wiſdom and Courage, for Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility and Meekneſs, for Charity and Hoſpitality, was one of the greateſt Ornaments of the Church and Nation wherein he lived: But unleſs I had his own Eloquence, I ſhould not attempt it. A ſorrowful Heart, a thick Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, and a trembling Hand, will but overſhade and darken the Lines of ſo fair a Piece; and therefore I muſt beg of you, who knew him in <hi>Oxford,</hi> in <hi>Hackney,</hi> in <hi>Exeter,</hi> and in this City, where he was ſo much followed, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded, and admired, to ſet him in his true Light to the World, and give him that great Character which he ſo juſtly deſerved, while I only mention the great Honour and Veneration we had for him in <hi>Ireland,</hi> in which King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom he ſoon made himſelf famous, and, for a Learned and Elegant Sermon, which I heard him Preach at his firſt coming, (and which was afterward Printed) I ſaw him Embraced by the greateſt Prelates, and courted to ſtay in that Country, and was ſoon after made Dean, and then Biſhop of <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoe,</hi> and afterward, moſt deſervedly, tranſlated to <hi>Derry.</hi> In the firſt of
<pb facs="tcp:109965:8"/>
which Biſhopricks (as I am informed) he ſpent about a Thouſand Pounds in Buildings and other Improvements: And, in the laſt, he was at a very great Expence to Beautifie and Adorn his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral, and in furniſhing it with Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans and Maſſy Plate; and, in both, he was a great Precedent of Piety and Holineſs. He was a burning and a ſhining Light. He knew that <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and did therefore preach loudly by example. His Actions were Inſtructive Sermons, and his Strict Life and Unblameable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation had great Influence on all about him.</p>
                  <p>At his Table he was piouſly pleaſant and religiouſly ingenious, and doubly feaſted all who did eat with him; for he had a clear Head and ſolid Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, a quick Fancy and a flowing Wit, and was every-way accompliſhed for Addreſs and for Diſcourſe, and was ſo Courteous and Affable, ſo Gentile, and ſo Obliging, ſo Inſtructive, and Communicative, that all who conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with him, loved and admired him; and though he kept a very Noble and

Hoſpitable Houſe, yet was it famous for Regularity and Order. And in the midſt of the greateſt Plenty, Gravity and Sobriety were moſt ſtrictly obſerved. It was indeed a Temple and an Oratory, for in it Prayers and Praiſes, Catechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and Reading the Scripture, were never omitted. He conſtantly expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to his Family, explained ſome part of the Leſſons, and made ſhort, but rare Obſervations upon them, and, beſide the Publick Prayers, he was very often at his Private Devotions, and ſpent much time in Divine Meditations.</p>
                  <p>Thus did he behave himſelf in his Houſe; thus did he Inſtruct his Family, and bring his Children up in the Nurture and Admonition of the Lord: And, if you follow him to the Pulpit, you'll find him there conſtantly, once a Sunday, while his Health permitted it, and ſurely all who heard him will ſay, his Sermons were Learned and Eloquent, Pious and Methodical, and, as his <hi>Motto</hi> was, <hi>Aut ſuavitate aut vi,</hi> he, either by ſweet Diſcourſes and charming Exhortations, or by ſtrength of Reaſon and powerful Arguments, drew many to Chriſt. He
<pb facs="tcp:109965:9"/>
never omitted that Duty, but preached in his Throne when he was not able to aſcend the Pulpit: And, for his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency in that Noble Faculty, he was ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated by all Men. He was followed and admired in all Places where he lived, and was juſtly eſteemed one of the beſt Preachers of our Age. And his Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes always ſmelt of the Lamp; they were very elaborate and well digeſted. He had a Noble Library, and delighted in it, and was, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſays of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus, Omnium Doctrinarum curioſiſſimus explorator.</hi> He was a good Linguiſt, and excelled in Polemick and Caſuiſtical Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity. Many flocked to him to have their Doubts reſolved; and he gave Light and Comfort to clouded and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted Conſciences; and was admirably accompliſhed with many other Parts of uſeful Learning.</p>
                  <p>And, if you conſider him as a Biſhop, you will own, that God had bleſſed him with Wiſdom and Sagacity, with Zeal and Courage, with Temper and Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and all other neceſſary Virtues for a Governour and Ruler in the Church, and ſurely none was more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb facs="tcp:109965:9"/>
of his Dioceſs, being conſtantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident, and bringing in learned and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious Men into all Livings in his Gift and Patronage: And was a moſt tender and indulgent, yet ſtrict and vigilant Ruler of his Clergy. He always treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them as Brethren and Friends, with all kindneſs and reſpect, and would ſpare no pains to protect them in their Rights; and uſed all his intereſt to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote them as they deſerved. In a word, he was every way qualified and adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for that great Charge; and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Preaching, a wiſe Government, and an even and ſteady Hand; by a winning Temper, an humble Courage and prudent Moderation, he gained upon Diſſenters, and brought many into the Communion of our Church, having fully convinced them, that her Doctrin was Pure and Primitive, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox and Apoſtolical: And did, upon all occaſions, ſhew himſelf a wiſe, a learned, and a pious Biſhop. He every way filled his Chair, and was an Honour to his See, and may deſervedly be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolled in the Catalogue of his learned Predeceſſors; for with ſuch has that See been bleſſed ever ſince the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And undoubtedly his Death will
<pb facs="tcp:109965:10"/>
be extreamly lamented in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; and ſure I am the Poor will have great reaſon to bewail it; for to them he was exceeding generous and chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and gave great Sums, every Year, amongſt them, beſides the Tenth of his Revenues, which he conſtantly laid by for ſuch uſes; and did alſo allow good Yearly Penſions to Students in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, to Miniſters Widows and other diſtreſſed Perſons, and did put Children to Trades, and largely contribute to the Building and Repairing of ſome Churches, and deſigned greater things, if God had ſpared him to return. But, alas! he is gone, and our poor unſetled Church has an extraordinary loſs in him: 'Tis a ſharp Stroke, an additional Judgment to loſe him now. But to God's Holy Will we muſt ſubmit, as he willingly and chearfully did when Death approached: He reſigned all with great Chriſtian Courage, and diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Philoſophically and Divinely of the Vanity and Uncertainty of all Subluna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Things, and ſetled all his Deſires upon the Things above; and, not long before his death, he diſcourſed of the Neceſſity and Sincerity of Repentance and Uniform Obedience in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
<pb facs="tcp:109965:10"/>
and inveighed with ſuch any Holy Zeal, againſt the Sins of theſe Nations, as might make the greateſt Debauchees of our Age quake and tremble to have heard him. And then, with reflecting on himſelf, he did, with great Grief and Sorrow, with Sighs and Tears, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail the leaſt Failures of his Life, and ſpent his Laſt Days in Self-examination, in Repentance and Prayer, and with great Devotion received the Holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, in which he found much Joy and Comfort, and had ſuch Inward Peace and Antepaſts of Bliſs, that he longed to be diſſolved and to be with Chriſt, and did very often beg of God to take him: And, on Thurſday laſt, his Prayer was heard, and God, in his Mercy, took him out of the Troubles of this Life, and called him up amongſt the Bleſſed, and changed his Fading Mitre into a Crown of Eternal Glory.</p>
                  <p>What then remains, but that we imitate his Virtue, honour his Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and commit his Body to his Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitory, there to ſleep till the Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, when he and all who have been diligent and induſtrious, painful and laborious in the Miniſtry, and have
<pb facs="tcp:109965:11"/>
been Precedents of Piety and Holineſs, of Juſtice and Integrity, will meet their Flocks with Joy and Comfort, and for turning them to Righteouſneſs, ſhall ſhine as Stars for ever and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. Which God grant we may all do, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

Supernaturally Performed. Now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there be ſo wide a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe two; yet where they are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to run on in a courſe, they will one fall into the other; and Goſpel Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations will make way for, and lead unto Goſpel Obedience: Yea, indeed there is no Divine Truth, how Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted, how Sublime and Speculative ſoever it may ſeem to be, but by the help of one or two Conſequences may be handed down along to clear and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect our Practice: And therefore the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſpeaking of the Whole of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Titus</hi> 1.1.</note> calls it <hi>The Myſtery of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs: And the Truth according to Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> He calls it not a Myſtery and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, or Truth and Godlineſs; but he knits and joyns them both together, the Myſtery and Truth of Godlineſs; a Truth, yea and a Truth wrapt up in a Myſtery, becauſe diſcovered only by a Divine Light; and yet a Myſtery of Godlineſs, becauſe it is a Truth that tends to incline the Will and raiſe the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and ſo direct the Converſations of Men, unto Godlineſs and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>

Exinanition and Obedience, <hi>God hath highly Exalted him, and given him a Name above every Name, that at the Name of Jeſus every Knee ſhould bow.</hi> Now ſays the <hi>Apostle,</hi> be you alſo of the ſame Mind with Chriſt: Wherefore as he was Obedient, ſo be you alſo; do you <hi>Work,</hi> that is, Do you <hi>Obey:</hi> As he was humble, and emptied himſelf, be you alſo humble and lowly. <hi>Work with Fear and Trembling;</hi> That is, obey with Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility and Reverence, as the <hi>Phraſe</hi> imports and is often uſed in <hi>Scripture:</hi> That ſo as Chriſt obtained Glory and Exaltation, you alſo may be Exalted and Glorified with him. <hi>Work out your own Salvation.</hi> For theſe Words come in as a Parallel with Chriſt: As he was obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, ſo be you; as he was humble and emptied himſelf, ſo be you alſo hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; that ſo when he is Glorified, you may be Saved. <hi>Wherefore, work out your own Salvation with Fear and Trembling.</hi> And this I judge to be the <hi>Apostles</hi> ſcope in drawing this Concluſion.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>First,</hi> Here is a duty preſſed upon us,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and that is, <hi>To Work out our own Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> To explain the Words a little:</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>First,</hi> For <hi>Salvation,</hi> you may take it for the whole ſupernatural State of a Chriſtian, begun here in Grace,<note place="margin">1. What Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is.</note> and to be finiſhed hereafter in Glory. And,</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly, To Work out this Salvation,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">2. What it is to work out Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> is nothing but to continue and perſevere in ways of Obedience, until through them, that <hi>Salvation</hi> that is begun here on Earth, be perfected in Heaven.<note place="margin">What it implies.</note> 
                           <hi>To Work out our Salvation,</hi> therefore, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies three things:</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="6" facs="tcp:109965:17"/>
                           <note place="margin">1. Pains and Labour.</note>
                           <hi>First,</hi> Pains and Labour. <hi>Salvation</hi> is that which muſt be wrought out; it is that which will make the Soul pant and breath, yea run down with Sweat to obtain it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">2. Diligence and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy.</note>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> It implies Conſtancy and Diligence. A Chriſtian that would work out <hi>Salvation,</hi> muſt always be imployed about it. It is a Webb into which we muſt weave the whole Thread of our Lives. That Man that works at Salvation only by ſome paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate fits, and then within a while un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does it all again by foul Apoſtacy, and Notorious Sins, that Man will never work Salvation out. No, it muſt be Diligence and Conſtancy that muſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect that.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">3. Succeſs.</note>
                           <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It promiſes Succeſs and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment alſo: And this is a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty encouragment to enforce the Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. Though the Work be difficult, our Strength little, the Enemies ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and the Oppoſitions powerful; yet continue working, your Labour ſhall not be in Vain; though it be hard work, it ſhall not be long work; for it ſhall be wrought out, and what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:109965:17"/>
was your Work, ſhall be your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; and what before was your La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, ſhall be your Wages. And this <hi>Salvation</hi> that was ſo painful in working ſhall be moſt bleſſed in the Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> Here is the expreſs way and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> manner how this Work ſhould be done, and that is, <hi>With Fear and Trembling. Work out your own Salvation with Fear and Trembling.</hi> Now this <hi>Fear,</hi> is not to be taken for a Fear of Diffidence, Perturbation or Deſpondency; for this is ſo contrary to the Duty of working out Salvation, as that it only ſtupifies and dulls us: And as in other matters, ſo in Spirituals, it hinders both Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels and performances. But this <hi>Fear and Trembling,</hi> that muſt qualify our Obedience, is nothing elſe, but an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Self-Reſignation, Self-Denyal, and a Holy awe and reverence of God, with which Humility and Reverence, the higheſt degree of ſpiritual Joy and Aſſurance is ſo far from being inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent, that it uſually ſprings from it, and is built upon it. This now is meant by <hi>Fear and Trembling,</hi> and ſo the Phraſe is often uſed in <hi>Scripture.</hi> So
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:109965:18"/>
the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Pſalm</hi> 2.12.</note> 
                           <hi>Serve the Lord with Fear, and rejoyce with Trembling.</hi> It is not meant of any deſponding diffident Fear, but only of an awful reverential Fear of God, joyned with Self-abaſement. And ſo St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians, ſays of Titus,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.15.</note> 
                           <hi>That he was received with Fear and Trembling.</hi> There was no Reaſon why <hi>Titus</hi>'s coming ſhould cauſe Fear and Trembling, which was ſo much deſired: Only the meaning is, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him with Fear and Reverence. And ſo <hi>Servants</hi> are Commanded to be <hi>Obedient unto their Maſters:</hi> So here, <hi>Work out your own Salvation with Fear and Trembling:</hi>
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.5.</note> That is, Work it out with Humility, Self-Abaſement and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
                           <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Here is the Reaſon of this Exhortation; <hi>For it is God who worketh in you both to will and to do of his good Pleaſure.</hi> Wherein now lies the Strength of the Reaſon? Poſſibly it might ſeem rather to a Carnal Judgment, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragment to Sloath, than an incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragment to working and Obedience. For if God work in us both the Will and the Deed; What need we then be ſo ſolicitous about the accompliſhment
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:109965:18"/>
of our Salvation, which not ſo much we our ſelves, as God works out for us? It would rather ſeem to be a greater Motive for us to work, if the <hi>Apostle</hi> had ſaid, God will not aſſiſt you, and therefore look to your ſelves. But yet there are two ways without torturing the Words, whereby we may make them confeſs wherein their great Strength lies. The one is by reducing this Reaſon to the Duty. And the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is by referring it to the manner of Performing of the Duty.</p>
                        <p>
                           <label type="milestone">

                           </label> 
                           <hi>First,</hi> If we refer it to the Duty of working out Salvation, then the Force and Strength of it lies in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of that Aid and Aſſiſtance that God by working in us affords us, to the working out of our own Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Work? <hi>Why, Alas may ſome ſay, How can we Work? Are not the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Obedience Divine and Supernatural? And is it not an Almighty Power alone that can inable us to do what is Supernatural? Are we Omnipotent? Doth not God here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in plainly ſeek Advantages against us, in bidding us thus to Work, who have no Hands, nor Strength to Work with?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="10" facs="tcp:109965:19"/>
                           <label type="milestone">

                           </label> No, by no means, for what God Commands us to do, he will aſſiſt us in the doing of it. And though Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence be Supernatural, and we are Weak and Impotent, yet God is Omnipotent: Work therefore, for this Omnipotent God works in you, both to Will and to Do. And thus appears the force of the Reaſon, if you apply it to the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Now if you thus refer it, then Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,</p>
                        <p>That all Ability in, and all Incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to Obedience proceeds from God's working in us what he requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth from us. And thus as Chriſt ſaid, my Father worketh hitherto, and I work: So may a Weak Chriſtian ſay, what I do, is above my own Strength indeed; but my God and my Father worketh hitherto in me, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is that I am inabled thus to work.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> If we refer this Reaſon to the manner of performing of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that it muſt be <hi>with Fear and Trembling,</hi> as if the Exhortation run thus, Be humble and awful in your O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, <hi>For it is God who worketh in
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:109965:19"/>
you both to will and to do,</hi> and then it carries a double force with it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>First,</hi> That the due Conſideration of Gods working in us, is the greateſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement imaginable to a Self-Debaſing Humiliation. There is nothing that will ſooner take down Phariſaical Pride and Boaſting, than ſometimes to be Catechiſing our ſelves with thoſe two or three Queſtions and Interrogatories of the <hi>Apostle; Who made thee to differ?</hi>
                           <note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.7.</note>
                           <hi>What hast thou that thou didst not receive? Now if thou hast received it, Why dost thou Boast as if thou hadſt not received it?</hi> Why doſt thou Boaſt and Glory, O vain Weak Man, when all thou haſt and all thou doſt is from God's free and arbitrary working in thee! Alas, there is nothing of all thy Graces or Duties to be aſcribed unto thy ſelf, unleſs it be the Imperfections and Weakneſſes of them. And this ſhould cauſe us when we are moſt ſtrongly carried out in the ways of God, and in the Duties of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Obedience, moſt of all to renounce our ſelves, and our own ſufficiency; and look upon it as an evident Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that of our ſelves we are able to do nothing, becauſe through God we
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:109965:20"/>
are inabled to do ſo much, yea, to do all things.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> Since all we do is wrought in us by God, this ſhould cauſe us to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey with a Holy Fear and Reverence, leſt by our Miſcarriages we ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke God to withdraw from us, on whom depends all the Ability and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er we have to obey: <hi>It is God that work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in you, and therefore work out your own Salvation with Fear and Trembling.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This now ſhall ſuffice for the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and explaining of the Words. That which I ſhall preſs upon all, is the Duty of this Exhortation of the <hi>Apoſtle.</hi> And the Propoſition I ſhall lay down from them, is this,</p>

                        <p>

                        </q>
                        <p>To mention places for the proof of this were to tranſcribe the <hi>Bible;</hi> we can no where open this <hi>Bleſſed Book</hi> but we find this Truth proved to us, either di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:109965:20"/>
or by conſequence, for it is the very Genius of the <hi>Scripture.</hi> And yet it is ſtrange in theſe Days to ſee how dubiouſly ſome Men (who would be thought admirers of Free Grace) ſpeak of obedience and working, as if it were the brand of a legal Spirit, and as great a Stranger to a Chriſtians Warrant, as it is to their practice. Oh it is a ſoft and eaſie <hi>Doctrin</hi> to bid Men ſit ſtill and believe (as if God would Tranſlate Men to Heaven upon their Couches,) to tell them that all that they have now to do, is but to labour for more aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, to Praiſe God, and to Sing Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelujahs unto him. And ſo alſo it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces much to their abundant Comfort; does it not? to tell them, that God ſees no Sin in them, nor requires no Duty from them? That Repentance and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation are legal things belonging on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to younger Perſons, and not to the Heirs of the Promiſes? Oh! Who could think it poſſible that ſuch Dreams and Fantaſtick deluſions could poſſeſs ſo many Mens Hearts that ever heard the <hi>Scripture</hi> ſpeak in its own Language, or that ever read what <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf, the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> or the Bleſſed <hi>Apoſtles</hi> have written, who bid us <hi>to work the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:109965:21"/>
works of God?</hi> To give all Diligence, to abound in all the Fruits of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs? Is it poſſible that theſe Notions ſhould be diſperſed by ſome, and entertained by others, but becauſe it always hath been the policy of the <hi>Devil,</hi> wherein he hath ſped ſo well, ſtill to vent thoſe Doctrines that indulge the Fleſh, under the Name and Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage of <hi>Free Grace</hi> and <hi>Goſpel attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments?</hi> But of this more hereafter.

                           <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Why hath God ſo often promiſed us Aſſiſtance, if it be not that thereby we ſhould be incouraged to work? He ſtands by us to confirm our Hearts, to ſtrengthen our Hands, to help our Weakneſs, to quicken our Deadneſs, to recruit our Graces by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Supplies; and wherefore is all this but that we might work? God ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than we ſhall not work, he himſelf will ſet us at work; nay he will main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain us at our work, and in our work upon his own coſt. He gives us Aid,

and promiſes Aſſiſtance only for this end, that we might work out our own Salvation.<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5.</note>

They cannot ſo much as Will their own ſalvation unleſs God give them to Will; much leſs then can they work out their ſalvation: Or elſe it concerns all that live under the ſound of the Goſpel, though Reprobates and caſt-aways, though dead in Treſpaſſes and Sins. And is it rational, is it juſt and equal to bid dead Men work? Or doth it become that God, who would be thought by us to be infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely merciful and compaſſionate, to mock and deride humane Miſeries, in requiring
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:109965:23"/>
of them things that are impoſſible?

                           <hi>Firſt,</hi> This ſerious and preſſing Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation to Obedience and Working, doth not ſuppoſe in us, nor is it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that it ſhould ſuppoſe in us a Power to obey, I mean it of a preſent and actual Power; neither doth our want of Power take off our Obligation to obey. It may and will be granted, that there is no Command of God, but doth ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a Power once beſtowed. Whether or no his abſolute uncontroulable Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty might have required that from us that is above our Power ever to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, may rather modeſtly be doubted, than peremptorily concluded: Yet this is certain, that thoſe very Duties that now we complain we have no Strength and Power to perform, were once as ſubject to our Power and the Freedom of our own Wills, as now natural and moral Actions are: Subject (I ſay) to our Power, either to perform them, or not to perform them; not as though we came now into the World with this Power, for we are all dead and ſtill-born in reſpect of Grace; but as having this Power in our <hi>firſt Parent</hi> who was
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:109965:24"/>
our <hi>Repreſentative,</hi> for in him we muſt be conſider'd as exiſtent even when he exiſted; and what he received, it was for us, and what he did was done by us, and what he loſt we loſt in him. Now if we have loſt this Power of Obeying, muſt God alſo loſe his Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Sovereignty of Commanding? Muſt he leſſen his Authority, as we leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen our Ability? Truly had <hi>Adam</hi> once thought of this ſlight, he might have ſinn'd himſelf quite from under the command and dominion of his Creator, and might ſoon have become thus free. Do not you your ſelves think you may, if a <hi>Debtor</hi> of yours through his own default becomes a <hi>Bankrupt,</hi> require your <hi>Debt</hi> of him? So ſtands the Caſe here between God and us; we are all diſabled to pay the <hi>Debt</hi> of Obedience that we owe to God, but yet it is through our own default; and the Power that we had, is not ſo much loſt, as wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully thrown away; and may not God juſtly come upon us for our <hi>Debt?</hi> Our want of Power takes not off our obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Obedience, becauſe it is through a wilful defect that we are deprived of that Power. If a Servant throw away his <hi>Tools</hi> with which he ſhould work
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:109965:25"/>
may not his Maſter juſtly expect his Work from him, though he knows he cannot work without them? God's Commands reſpect not the Impotency that we have contracted, nor do they therefore abate any thing of their Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; but they reſpect that Power and Ability that was once conferred and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon us: Yea, were it ſo that God could with <hi>Juſtice</hi> require no more from us than what at preſent we have Power and Ability to perform, this would make the Grace of God, <hi>Firſt,</hi> vain and fruitleſs; and, <hi>Secondly,</hi> dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and deſtructive.</p>

                           <hi>Firſt, This would make void the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning Grace of God:</hi> For according to this Doctrin, nothing could be required of us if we could do nothing; but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Grace we can do nothing, and therefore if Grace be not beſtowed on us, nothing can juſtly be required from us, and if nothing be required nothing is due from us, and then we do not ſin in not performing any thing; and where there is no ſin, certainly there can be no place for pardoning Grace and Mercy. And ſo theſe wiſe Men, who think they do ſo much befriend the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:109965:25"/>
Grace and Mercy of God in all haſte, in affirming that God requires nothing from us, but what at preſent we have Power to perform, are injurious to the Mercy of God in making of it void as to Pardon and Remiſſion.</p>
                        <p>

Is it not becauſe they will not do what they are able to do? And whence is it that they have this Ability? Is it not from the Grace of God's Spirit? And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if they have not Grace to make them able to do more than their own corrupt Wills are willing to do, God could not juſtly condemn them, and conſequently that of the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſhould ſtand no longer true,<note place="margin">

                        <p>But now there are <hi>two Ends</hi> why God Commands us thus to work though we are not able, according to which God is very ſerious in commanding us thus to work.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="25" facs="tcp:109965:26"/>And God doth this, <hi>Firſt,</hi> That he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> may hereby convince us of our own Weakneſs, and that wretched Eſtate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which our Sins, have brought us; that he might humble and abaſe us when we reflect how far we are fallen from our firſt Perfection and Excellency. When we conſider on the one Hand that God requires nothing from us now, but what we once had a Power to perform; and then on the other Hand conſider how little, yea how much of that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing it is that now we have Power to perform; this convinces us how miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably great our Fall is, that makes thoſe things impoſſible to us, that once were both eaſie and delightful.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> God loves to deal with Men <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> as with rational Creatures, that have free Faculties, capable of moral Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, fit Subjects to be wrought upon by Precepts, Counſels, Commands and Exhortations, as well as by Internal and Efficacious Grace; that Arguments and Motives may perſuade without, as Grace ſways within; that ſo by both he might render them a willing Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the Day of his Power. And
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:109965:27"/>
therefore they are not in vain, neither to thoſe that ſhall be ſaved, nor to thoſe that Periſh.</p>

                           <hi>Firſt,</hi> To thoſe that ſhall be ſaved, theſe are the Inſtruments which the Spirit of God makes uſe of to incline their Wills and conquer their Affections into the Obedience of Chriſt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are not in vain. In conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ordinarily, if not always, the <hi>Moral</hi> work goes before the <hi>Phyſical.</hi> That is, there is, firſt the rational Perſuaſion, before there is the efficacious and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining Motion: For God when he works on Man, he accommodates him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſuitable to the Nature of Man; that as he is a Creature, ſo he may be and is the Subject of Gods efficacious Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and as he is Rational, ſo he may be guided by Counſels, lead by Perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, over-awed by Convictions; and therefore when God Converts any, he takes both theſe ways, inwardly he works by effectual Grace, powerfully ſubduing the Will as a Creature ſubject unto it; and outwardly he works by moral Suaſions, and Authoritative Commands, whereby he inclines the will ſweetly and freely to conſent to the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:109965:27"/>
Power of that inward Grace, which indeed he ſhall never, nay indeed he cannot reſiſt; and both theſe together do concur (as I ſaid before) to make a willing People in the Day of Gods Power. And,</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> For thoſe that Periſh, theſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Commands have a double end and uſe.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Firſt,</hi> They are Inſtruments in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Hand of the common work of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, to raiſe them up to all thoſe moral good things that they attain to, ſhort of true and ſaving Grace. It is Wonderful truly to ſee how the raging Wickedneſs of the World is dared by a Command charged with a Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. <hi>Herod</hi> heard <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> who doubtleſs laid the Law home to him, ſo that he did many things. <hi>Abime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lech</hi> and <hi>Laban</hi> were warned in a Dream, whereby God over-ruled and prevented that Wickedneſs that was intended by them. Were they compelled to what they did? No, God loves to rule the World in a rational way; ſo that though he acts and moves wicked Men to that good that they do, yet he doth
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:109965:28"/>
it by moral Conſiderations, and ſuch Inducements as do moſt comport and ſuit with the Liberty of their own Will: Promiſes incourage, Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings deter, Counſels direct, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands inforce, and all theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur inſtrumentally to awe the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and to incline the Wills even of wicked Men themſelves. Whoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience can gainſay this? Let the vileſt Sinner freely ſpeak, when he hath been moſt mad and wild upon his Luſts, hath not oftentimes ſome Command or Threatning ſuddenly ſhot it ſelf in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt his Conſcience and Sin? Hath not two or three weak Words ſilently whiſpered to him, whence or from whom he knows not, ſtopt his way and given a Check to his Luſt, when it was ſwelling ready to break forth into Act? And whence have they this Power? It is not from themſelves; for why then doth it not always ſo <hi>work?</hi> But it is from God's Inward and <hi>Phyſical,</hi> tho' but common <hi>Work,</hi> that when the Affections are moſt furious, and Corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption moſt raging, will effectually per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade to reſtrain and aſſwage.</p>

                           <pb n="29" facs="tcp:109965:28"/>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> Another End is, hereby God <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> leaves them without Excuſe: If they periſh they ſhall have nothing to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend againſt God. Hath he not often warned, and counſelled and threatned them? Hath he not told them, with as much earneſtneſs and vehemency as the words of his Miniſters could deliver it, <hi>That the wages of ſin is death,</hi> and the end of thoſe ways wherein they walk will be Shame and eternal Deſtruction? Have they not with all Seriouſneſs and Entreaties been called upon again and again to <hi>repent and turn</hi> from the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitful Works of Darkneſs, and to work the Works of God? Can the Mouth of God or Man ſpeak plainer, when they have been calling and crying after any, <hi>Turn ye, turn ye, why will you die?</hi> This is that which from our Souls we do beſeech and intreat at the Hands of Sinners, even for the Blood and Bowels of Jeſus Chriſt; nay, for the Blood and Bowels of their own precious Souls, which they are wilfully ſpilling upon the Ground, that they would <hi>turn and live.</hi> Now there is not one that hears this ſerious Obteſtation and is not obedient to it, but his Blood, even the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:109965:29"/>
Blood of his Soul, will lie upon him for ever. What is it that Men expect? Muſt God drive Men to Heaven by force and violence, whether they will or no? He hath laid Promiſes and Threatnings before them, he Exhorts and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands: And if theſe things will not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with Men whoſe Faculties are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, whoſe Reaſon is ſound, and whoſe Wills are free; Think not fooliſhly to charge God, for he is free from the Blood of all Men, and Sinners will be found to be Self-murderers and Self-deſtroyers. <hi>If I had not come and ſpoken unto them,</hi> ſays our Saviour, <hi>they had then had no ſin, but now they have no cloak for their ſin.</hi> So if God had not come and ſpoken un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Sinners, they had neither had Sin nor Condemnation; but now that he hath ſpoken to them ſo often, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted them ſo frequently and earneſtly, therefore, <hi>now they have no cloak for their ſin.</hi> God hath ſpoken, and his ſpeaking will ſtrike every impenitent Wretch dumb and ſilent at the great Day, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they pretend to now. And this is a <hi>ſecond Particular</hi> in <hi>Anſwer</hi> to this <hi>Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> God doth not mock Mens Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs when he commands them to work, but hath great, wiſe and weighty Ends why he doth it.</p>

                           <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To come ſomewhat nearer: There is indeed no ſuch Impotency and Weakneſs in Man, but if he will he may work out his own Salvation. I ſpeak not this to aſſert the power of Man to work out Salvation without the Aid of ſpecial Grace, to encline the Will; but if the Will be once enclined and made willing, there is nothing more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to make a Man able; I ſay, where there is ſpecial Grace given to make the Will willing to convert, to believe and to repent, there is nothing more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to make a Man able; becauſe Converſion, Faith and Repentance chiefly conſiſt in the Act of the Will it ſelf; now if the Will wills Repentance, it doth repent; if it wills Faith, it doth believe; and ſo of the reſt: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is nothing more required to make a Man able than what he hath in a ſtate of un-regeneracy; only to make him willing is required ſpecial Grace, which they that favour the undue liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Will do deny.

                           <hi>Life.</hi> It is true there is an impotency in the Will, but this is only its ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borneſs and obſtinacy; it will not hearken to God's Call, it will not obey his Commands, it will not ſtrive againſt Sin nor perform Duties, and therefore it cannot. Our Cannot is not indeed an impotency that we lie under ſo much, as ſtubborneſs of our <hi>Wills.</hi> There is not the greateſt Sinner, who hath wrought Iniquity with both Hands greedily, but may work out his own Salvation if he will; <hi>if he be but once willing,</hi> he hath that already that may make him able; God puts no new Powers into the Soul when he converts it. It is true, the Will cannot incline it ſelf to Obedience with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Grace, but yet it can intend it if it will; it is its ſtubborneſs that makes it impotent. It is in the things of Grace, as in other free Actions of a Man's Life with a proportionable abatement: A Man can Speak and Walk if he will, but if he be reſolutely ſet not to do theſe things, he cannot do them ſo long as that Reſolution remains, though ſimply and abſolutely he can do them; doth this argue any impotency? So is it here, you may obey and work if you will; but if you are reſolutely bent againſt
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:109965:30"/>
theſe, if you are reſolved not to do them, while that Reſolution continues you cannot do them; but this argues not any natural impotency, but a moral impotency only; this is an impotency of Stubborneſs and Perverſneſs. Never therefore plead the inability of your Will, no it is through your own ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born Reſolution if you periſh; you are reſolved for Hell and Deſtruction, and if you are plunged into them, it is through your own Wilfulneſs, and not through Weakneſs.</p>

                           <hi>Fourthly,</hi> To come yet a little nearer to Conſcience and Practice: Theſe very Men that thus make their impotency a pretence for their Sloth, they do not indeed believe what they pretend and aſſert here; they do not believe that they are thus impotent, no it is in the inward and ſecret Thoughts of them all that they have a Power to work out their own Salvation; and therefore whether they have or have not Power, yet ſtill they are inexcuſable, if while they think they have Power, yet they will not ſtrive and endeavour to put it forth. Thoſe Men who thus plead impotency and want of power to Obey
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:109965:31"/>
and work out their Salvation, though they ſpeak theſe things, yet they believe not a word of what they ſay, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are inexcuſable, if they ſtrive not to put forth that Power that they ſuppoſe they have into Act. Although a Man's Feet be chain'd and fetter'd that he cannot walk nor ſtir, yet if he thinks himſelf at Liberty, and yet will ſit ſtill, judge you whether the Fault be not wholly to be imputed to his want of Will, and not to his want of Power; for he thinks himſelf free and able to move, but will not try. So is it here; wicked Men do think they have Power to Work, however they ſpeak other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſometimes, and therefore they are utterly inexcuſable if they do not Work; this is as clear as the Light, and their Slothfulneſs therefore proceeds not from their Weakneſs, but from their Wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And I ſhall endeavour by ſome Arguments to convince Sinners, that they do indeed think and believe that they have this Power to work out their own Salvation, whatever they may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to, and therefore they are inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable if they do not ſtrive and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour for to do it. And,</p>

                           <hi>First,</hi> Did you never, when God hath ſhaken his Rod over you, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe and reſolve to work? By his Rod, I mean either ſome Convictions or Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions; have not theſe made you to enter into Ingagements with God that you would obey him, and walk more holily and ſtrictly for the future? And did you not really thus reſolve to do? Few, I believe, there are but have ſome time or other, under ſome Fit of Sickneſs or ſome pang of Conſcience, thus done. And what, did you reſolve all this, and yet at the ſame time think and believe you could do nothing at all? Did you only mock God? Did you on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dally and play with your own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences? No, certainly, Conſcience was too much provoked, too much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, and too broad awakened to be ſo jeſted withal. We find this very Temper in the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> when they were affrighted with the terrible Voice of God from <hi>Mount Sinai</hi> in the 5th of <hi>Deutronomy.</hi> See how confidently, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that Conviction,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.27.</note> they promiſed and reſolved, <hi>Speak thou unto us what the Lord our God ſhall ſay unto thee, and we will do it.</hi> And ſo the <hi>Jews</hi> alſo, when
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:109965:32"/>
they were in great Diſtreſs and Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, when the Whip and the Rod was over them then they take up large Reſolutions, and make great Promiſes what they will be and do,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Jer.</hi> 42.2.</note> 
                           <hi>Whether it be good or whether it be evil,</hi> ſay they, <hi>we will obey the voice of the Lord our God.</hi> And oh! how many pious Purpoſes and holy Reſolutions have the Dangers, Fears and ſick Beds of many Men been Witneſſes unto? Have they not heard Sinners cry out, <hi>Lord, ſpare a little, give us ſome ſpace, try us once more Lord, and we will reform our ſinful Lives, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form neglected Duties; never more will we return to Folly.</hi> And are not theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions and Promiſes evident Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, that you thought you had Power to do what you thus reſolved to do? Who is there but hath ſome time or other, under ſome Trouble and Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, taken up ſuch Reſolutions of Obedience as theſe? And certainly you dare not ſo much mock God, and dally with your own Conſciences under ſuch Convictions, as to make ſuch Promiſes, but that you think you can perform what you promiſe. And that is one Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="37" facs="tcp:109965:32"/>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> Did you never in your <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> whole lives perform a Duty to God? Did you never pray to him? Are there any ſo deſperately Prophane, ſo utterly loſt as to any ſhews and appearances of Goodneſs, as not to have prayed or performed one Duty unto God in his whole Life? Why now to what end have you prayed and performed theſe Duties that you have done? Was it not for Salvation? And did you work for Salvation and at the ſame time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve you could not work? No, this is impoſſible that ever any Mans Practice ſhould maintain ſuch a contradiction. What ever Mens Opinions are, yet their works ſhew that they think they have Power; for ſomthing muſt be done, though it be but formally, though but a ſlight, cold, heartleſs, <hi>Lord have Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy on me,</hi> or a cuſtomary, <hi>Lord forgive me;</hi> yet ſomething Conſcience requires, and this Men reckon and account the working out Salvation.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Wherefore is it that you <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> truſt to and rely upon your works, if indeed you think you have no Power to work out your own Salvation by
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:109965:33"/>
them? Would it be ſo hard and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to take Men off from leaning too much upon their Works, if they did not believe they had a Power to work out their own Salvation by them? Men do apprehend ſome worth, ſome value and ſufficiency in what themſelves do in order to Eternity. For, bid them forgo and renounce their own Works, their own Righteouſneſs; this is a hard ſaying, and they can as eaſily renounce and forgo all Hopes of Happineſs and Salvation, as renounce their own Works. Now whence is it that Men are ſo difficultly brought unto the renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing their own Works? Why it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by them they Hope to obtain Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. And can there be ſuch a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple in Men, and yet at the ſame time believe and think that they cannot work out their own Salvation? It is very evident therefore, whatever No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions Men may take up to ſtop the Mouth of a clamorous Conſcience when it calls them to working and labouring, yet they do not themſelves believe what they ſay concerning their impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency, but do really think they have a Power to work out their own Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="39" facs="tcp:109965:33"/>
                           <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Did you never when the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Spirit of God hath been dealing with your Hearts and Conſciences, when it hath been perſuading you to enter up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Courſe of Obedience, did you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver procraſtinate and uſe Delays? Did you never ſtifle the Breathings, and reſiſt the Motions of the Holy Spirit, thinking it time enough to do what it puts you upon hereafter? <hi>What need I begin ſo ſoon to vex Fleſh and Blood? What, deny the Pleaſures of my Life as ſoon as I come to reliſh and taſte them? When Sickneſs and gray Hairs admoniſh me, and tell me I am near Eternity; when old Age promiſeth me, that the ſeverity and ſtrictneſs of Religion ſhall not laſt long to trouble me, then will I repent and believe, and work out my own Salvation.</hi> Speak truly and deal plainly with your own Conſciences, have not theſe been the fooliſh Reaſonings of your own Hearts? Have you not often thus promiſed God and your own Conſciences? And doth not all this imply that you thought you had a Power to do it? Why did you delay and put it off, if you thought you had no Power to do it at laſt? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou art <hi>inexcuſable,</hi> O Man, whoever
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:109965:34"/>
thou art that wilt not work; it is in Vain to plead thou wantedſt Power, God will confute thee by thy ſelf and out of thy own Mouth. What wilt thou ſay, thou hadſt no Power? Why thou thoughteſt that thou hadſt Power, and yet wouldſt not work, nor endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour ſo to do; and therefore thy Ruin, if thou periſheſt, is as wilful, and thy Condemnation will be as Juſt, as if thou hadſt Power and wouldeſt not work. And this is the <hi>Fourth Anſwer</hi> to this <hi>Objection,</hi> Men do really believe that they have Power to work, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are inexcuſable if they will not endeavour to put it forth.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
                           <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Men will not plead ſo Fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhly, no not in matters of far lower con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment than the Salvation of their Souls is. Would a Maſter, when he Commands his Servant to work, take this as a ſufficient Excuſe for his Sloth and Idleneſs, that he hath no Power to work, till God Acts and Moves him? Why this is a Truth, that he cannot do it unleſs God inable him; and it may as well be Objected by your Servants to you, and with more Reaſon too, than by you unto God. Pray tell me,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:109965:34"/>
what Power have I to Speak one Word, or you to Hear one Word more unleſs God concurs to it? Nay, we are not ſufficient to think as of our ſelves; yet we do not make this an Excuſe to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear thoſe Actions that are neceſſary. Do we therefore reſolve to do nothing becauſe it is impoſſible for us to do any thing unleſs God concur? What Stupid and dull Folly is this? No, but we put it plainly and hourly to the Trial; and never could any one produce that Man that could ever ſay, God was wanting to him in his concurrence, when he would have done an Action. What a miſerable ridiculous Task would it be, if in every Action of our Lives where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we can do nothing without God, we ſhould ſtill be queſtioning Gods concurrence with us! When you Sit, do you diſpute whether God will inable you to Ariſe? When you Walk, do you every Step you take, queſtion whether God will concur to another Step? No Men put theſe things to the Trial; and though it be impoſſible that they ſhould live, move or ſtir, till God act and move them, yet this hinders not Mens endeavours, no nor is it any matter of diſcouragment to them. Now why
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:109965:35"/>
ſhould we not do ſo in Spirituals as well as in Temporals? Are they not of greater Concernment? Do they not more deſerve the Trial? It is true, we can do nothing without God's concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; yet let us put it to the trial whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or no God will not concur when we endeavour. Certainly that Man muſt be for ever nameleſs that can ſay, he was truly willing and did ſincerely endeavour to do any good Thing, and God did not inable him.</p>

                           <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Conſider this, altho' wicked Men had Power to work out their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, yet they would never do it; and therefore it is a vain and moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable pretence for Sloth, to plead want of Power; for had wicked Men Power they would never Obey. <hi>But how can any one tell that? What, not obey if we had Power?</hi> Why no; and the Reaſon is this, becauſe there is no wicked Man in the World that hath done ſo much, or that doth ſo much as he is able to do, no not ſo much as he is able to do without ſpecial Grace and Aſſiſtance; and therefore, it is not Ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility but wilful Sloth that deſtroys Men. Sinners, ask your own Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:109965:35"/>
this Queſtion, Was there not one Duty more that you could have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed? Was there not one Temptation, nor one Corruption more that you could have reſiſted? Could you not have pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and read, and heard, and meditated more upon Heavenly Things, even then when your Hearts and Thoughts have been vain and worldly, yea, ſinful and deviliſh? Might not that time have been ſpent in holy Converſe, that you have trifled away in Idleneſs and in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing, or that which is worſe than nothing? What Force or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint is laid upon you? Is there any Violence uſed to you? Can you not think? And if you can, can you not think of God as well as of the Things of the World, or think upon your Luſts? Can you not Speak? And if you can, can you not ſpeak of God, of Heaven, and the Concernments of another Life, as well as of your Trade, and Bargain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and other trivial Matters, which are below a Man, much more below a Chriſtian? What force is there put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Sinners? Doth the <hi>Devil</hi> ſcrew open the <hi>Drunkards</hi> Mouth, and pour down his intemperate Cups whether he will or no? Doth the <hi>Devil</hi> violently move
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:109965:36"/>
the black Tongue of the <hi>Blaſphemer</hi> and <hi>Swearer</hi> to rend and tear the holy Name of God, by horrid Oaths and Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies? Doth the <hi>Devil</hi> ſtrike Men dumb when they ſhould Pray, or Deaf when they ſhould Hear, or Senſeleſs when they ſhould underſtand and ponder? Is there any ſuch force or violence uſed unto any? Can you not avoid the one? And can you not do the other if you will? Yes you can, but you will not; and therefore neither would you work out your own Salvation if you could do it. Is there any hopes that you would ever willingly do the greater, who will not do the leſs? Let your Impotency and Weakneſs be what it will, your <hi>Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> lies not upon it, but upon your Wilfulneſs, ſo long as your Wilfulneſs is greater than your Weakneſs: No, it is not upon your Impotency that your precious and immortal Souls periſh eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, but it is only for lack of a Will to pity them, and to ſave them. <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners!</hi> wherefore then will you periſh? Why will you ſleep away your Souls into Hell? Will you go on drowſily to Deſtruction? Shall your Souls be ready to burn as a Brand in unquenchable Fire, and will you not ſtretch forth
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:109965:36"/>
your Hand to ſnatch it out? Is it more painful for you to Work, than to be Damned? Endeavour therefore to do what you can; labour and ſweat at Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation rather than fail of it: Let it not grate and fret your Conſciences in Hell, that you lie there for, a wilful Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect.</p>

And to make this evident, I ſhall lay down the due Bounds and Limits of each of them, that ſo it may appear what Chriſt hath done for us, and what he expects we ſhould do for our ſelves. Chriſt therefore hath done Two Things in order to the carrying on of our Salvation.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> Chriſt hath purchaſed Grace to be beſtowed upon them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whom he beſtows Salvation.<note place="margin">Eph. 4 8.</note> 
                           <hi>When he Aſcended up on high he led Captivity Captive, and gave Gifts unto Men,</hi> and among others, eſpecially the Gifts of Grace. <hi>For of his fulneſs,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">John 1.16.</note> ſays the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>have we all received, and Grace for Grace.</hi> And why did Chriſt make this purchaſe? Why did he merit Grace for us? Was it not that we might act it in Obedience? And if Chriſt merited Grace that we might Obey, is it ſenſe to <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi> that our Obedience is derogatory to Chriſt's Merit? If one end of Chriſt's doing all that he did for us, was to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able us to do for our ſelves, will any Man ſay, now I am bound to do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, becauſe Chriſt hath done all? How loſt are ſuch Men both to Reaſon and Religion, who undertake ſo to argue? No, Salvation was purchaſed and Grace was procured, that by the acting and exerciſe of that Grace we might attain to that Salvation; and
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:109965:39"/>
both theſe are to be preſerved entirely as things moſt Sacred, aſcribing them ſolely to the Merits of our Saviour. So far are we from Exhorting Men to work out their Salvation by way of Merit and Purchaſe, as that we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude them guilty of the higheſt <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg,</hi> and practical <hi>Blaſphemy</hi> againſt the <hi>Prieſtly Office</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt, who think by their own works to Merit the one or the other. And therefore though Jeſus Chriſt hath done thus much for us, yet that he might leave us alſo ſome work to do, I ſhall now ſhew what he expects from us in order to the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of our own Salvation. And as he hath done two things for us, ſo he requires two things from us. As.</p>

                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> He requires that we ſhould put forth the power of Grace in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring for Salvation, purchaſed for us.</p>

                           <hi>Firſt,</hi> He requires that all thoſe who are void of Grace ſhould labour for it
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:109965:39"/>
with that Power and Strength that they have,<note place="margin">Thoſe that are void of Grace muſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for it.</note> and in ſo doing they do not at all intrench upon the Work of Chriſt, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it at all derogatory to his Merits. See how the <hi>Prophet</hi> expreſſeth this, <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 18.<note place="margin">Ezek. 18.31.</note> 
                           <hi>Make you a new heart and a new ſpirit.</hi> He ſpeaks to thoſe that were in a ſtate of Nature, and he bids them <hi>make them a new heart and a new ſpirit; for why will you die?</hi> Noting, that if they did not labour after a new Heart and a new Spirit, they would certainly die the Death. Let every Sinner know that this is it that he is called upon for, this is that God expects from him, it is his Work to repent and return that he may live. It is his Work to labour to change his own Heart, and to renew his own Spirit: It is true, it is God's Work alſo,<note place="margin">Ezek. 11.19.</note> for he hath <hi>promiſed to give a new Heart and a new Spirit,</hi> and it is Chriſt's Work alſo as he is God, but yet it is not Chriſt's Work as Mediator. And therefore to endeavour the working of a new Heart in us, is not at all to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench upon the <hi>Mediatory Office</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt, for ſo his <hi>Office</hi> is not to work Grace, but to procure it; not to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant Grace, but to purchaſe it. You cannot therefore ſit down and ſay, what
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:109965:40"/>
need is there of my working? Chriſt hath already done all my Work for me to my Hands. No, Chriſt hath done his own Work, he hath done the Work of a <hi>Saviour</hi> and a <hi>Surety,</hi> but he never did the Work of a Sinner. If Chriſt by meriting Grace had beſtowed it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee and wrought it in thee, then indeed there was no more required of thee to become Holy, but to caſt back a lazy Look to the purchaſe of Jeſus Chriſt; then thy Sloth would have had ſome pretence why thou doſt not la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. But this will not do, our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our commands all Men <hi>To ſeek firſt the kingdom of God and the righteouſneſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Mat. 6.33. Acts 8.22.</note> And the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> exhorts <hi>Simon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi> himſelf, though <hi>in the gall of bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and in the bond of iniquity, yet pray,</hi> ſays he, <hi>if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee.</hi> Do not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cheat your own Souls into Perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by lazy Notions of Chriſt's Merits. What though Chriſt hath merited, yet God requires that you ſhould work and labour to change your own Hearts, and reform your own Lives; but if you ſit ſtill expecting till the meriting Grace of Chriſt drop down into your Souls, and of its own accord, and
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:109965:40"/>
change your Hearts; truly it may be before that time you your ſelves may drop down into Hell with your old unchanged Hearts. And this is the firſt thing Chriſt requires.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">2. Thoſe that have Grace muſt La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for Salvation.</note> Chriſt expects and requires that thoſe that have Grace ſhould put forth the utmoſt Strength and Power thereof, in labouring after that Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that he hath purchaſed for them: He hath merited Salvation for them, but it is to be obtained by them through their own Labour and Induſtry. Is not that which Chriſt hath already done, ſufficient for them? Is it not enough that he hath reconciled them to God by the Blood of the Covenant, that he hath made their Peace and procured their Pardon for them; But muſt Chriſt Repent, and Believe, and Obey for them? This is not to make him a <hi>Saviour,</hi> but a <hi>Drudg.</hi> He hath done what was meet and fit for a <hi>Mediatour</hi> to do; He now requires of us what is meet for <hi>Sinners</hi> to do; namely, to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, to Repent, to be Converted and to Obey: He now bids you Waſh and be Clean, and what would you have more? Would you have the great <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi>
                           <pb n="54" facs="tcp:109965:41"/>
come and ſtrike off your <hi>Leproſy,</hi> and you only mark the Cure, and do nothing thereunto? Or is it indeed enough that Salvation and Happineſs is purchaſed, that the way to Heaven is made paſſable, that the Bolts and Bars of the <hi>new Jeruſalem</hi> by Chriſt are bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off? Alas, what of all this! thou mayeſt ſtill be as far from Heaven and Glory as ever, if thou doſt not walk in the way that leads to it: Still thou art as far from entring into Heaven as ever, if, thou doſt not ſtrive at the entrance into the ſtrait Gate. It is therefore in vain that Chriſt died, it is in vain that thou art Juſtified, it is in vain that thou art Adopted, it is in vain that Heaven is prepared for thee: Chriſt may keep Heaven and Glory, and his Crowns and Robes for ever to himſelf, unleſs as he hath purchaſed theſe great things for his People, ſo alſo he hath purchaſed to himſelf a peculiar People Zealous of good Works: A People who by patient continuance in well doing ſeek for Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Immortality, and by that way obtain it. Thus we ſee Chriſts doing all for us is no excuſe for our doing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: He hath indeed done all for us that belongs to him as a <hi>Mediatour</hi> me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riting
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:109965:41"/>
and procuring Grace and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but he never intended to do all for us, as to the conveying of them to us, and making of them ours. No, that is ſtill to be done by us. And therefore tho Chriſt's Works alone were meritorious, yet by the actings of Faith we muſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply his Merit, and by the acting of Obedience confirm them to our ſelves.</p>
                        <p>I might add alſo, when Chriſt is ſaid to obey the Law in our ſtead, as well as to ſuffer in our ſtead: Though his bearing the puniſhment of the Law by Death doth excuſe and exempt us from ſuffering; yet his obeying of the Law doth not excuſe our Obedience unto the Law. Chriſt obeyed the Law in a far different reſpect to the Obedience which is now required from us: He obeyed as a Covenant of works, we only as a Rule of Righteouſneſs: If he had failed in the leaſt tittle he could not have purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Life that was promiſed; but we, though we fall infinitely ſhort in our Obedience may yet inherit that Life that Chriſt hath purchaſed. Chriſt's Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience was fully perfect, yet ours is not derogatory thereunto, becauſe it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from other grounds than Chriſt's did. But I will not proceed further
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:109965:42"/>
in this, only conclude this <hi>Anſwer</hi> with two practical things in reference to this <hi>Queſtion.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Firſt,</hi> So work with that Earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Conſtancy and Unweariedneſs in well doing, as if thy Works alone were able to juſtifie and ſave thee. Look with what Affection and Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency you would pray, if now God with a Voice from Heaven ſhould tell you, that for the next Prayer you make, you ſhould be either Saved or Damned. Look with what Reverence and Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion you would Hear, with what Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritualneſs of Heart you would Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, if your eternal State and Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were to be determined and fixed by the next of thoſe Duties that in this kind you were to perform; with the ſame Fervency, Affection and Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alneſs perform all the Obedience that you do. Why ſhould you not do ſo? Are not Gods Commands as perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and as Authoritative for Obedience under the Covenant of Grace, as they were under the Covenant of Works? Is not Obedience of as abſolute neceſſity now as ever, though not to the ſame end and purpoſe? And ſince the end of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:109965:42"/>
our Obedience is graciouſly changed, doth not this chang lay a farther obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of Gratitude upon us to obey God, who requires it from us, not as Merit, but as Duty? Still there is as great an obligation to obey now under the condition of the Covenant of Grace, as ever there was while Mankind ſtood under the tenour of the Covenant of Works. Certainly Chriſt's Merit was never given to ſlacken our Obedience, and it is the moſt unworthy, nay, let me ſay it is the moſt accurſed uſe that any Chriſtian can make of them, that from the Merit of Chriſt he ſhall take encouragement to grow more remiſs and ſlack in Obedience. Would you not therefore turn the Grace of God into Wantonneſs? Would you not abuſe the infinite Mercy of a Mediator? Think with your ſelves, how would I ſtrive and ſtruggle were I to ſtand or fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the account of my own Works and Duties; uſe the ſame Diligence, put forth the ſame Endeavours as indeed in that Caſe you would do. And,</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> So abſolutely depend and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> rely upon the alone Merits of Jeſus Chriſt for your Juſtification and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:109965:43"/>
as if you never had performed an Act of Obedience in all your Life. This is the right Goſpel-frame of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, ſo to work as if you were only to be ſaved by your own Merits, and withal ſo to reſt on the Merits of Chriſt as if you had never wrought any thing. It is a difficult thing to give to each of theſe its Due in our Practice. When we Work we are too apt to neglect Chriſt; and when we rely on Chriſt we are too apt to neglect Working: But that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian hath got the right skill and art of Obedience that can mingle theſe two to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, that can with one Hand work the Works of God, and yet at the ſame time with the other Hand lay faſt hold on the Merits of Jeſus Chriſt. Let this <hi>Antinomian</hi> Principle be for ever rooted out of the Minds of Men, that our working is derogatory to Chriſts Work. Never more think Chriſt hath done all your Work for you, for that is unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming the free Spirit of the Goſpel; but labour for that Salvation that he hath purchaſed and merited. Could ever ſuch ſenſeleſs <hi>Objections</hi> prevail with thoſe Men who ever ſeriouſly read that <hi>Scripture</hi> in <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Who gave himſelf for us that he might redeem us from all Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:109965:43"/>
and purify to himſelf a peculiar Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple zealous of good Works?</hi> Were this place ſeriouſly ponder'd over by Men, they would be aſhamed to <hi>Object</hi> any longer, that our Duties and Works are derogatory to the purchaſe of Chriſt, for <hi>he gave himſelf for this end that he might purchaſe ſuch a People that might be zealous of good Works.</hi> But truly when Sloth and Ignorance meet together, if you tell Men what Powers their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures have to work, and how neceſſary Obedience is to Salvation, that thereby we might excite and quicken their Hearts to Obedience, they with the <hi>Sluggard</hi> fold their Arms in their Boſom doing nothing, telling us theſe Doctrins are <hi>Arminianiſm</hi> and flat <hi>Popery;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in Deed and in Truth they are as far diſtant from either of them as Light is from Darkneſs; it is their Ignorance and Sloth only that makes them think ſo. But deceive not your ſelves, this <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin</hi> is ſuch that whether it take hold on your Judgments and Underſtandings now, I know not; but this I know aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly, it ſhall take hold of your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, either here or hereafter, and then it will not ſuffice you to make this Excuſe, either that you had no Power
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:109965:44"/>
to do any thing, or that Chriſt hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready done all Things for you. And ſo much for the <hi>Second Objection.</hi>

                           <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe all our working is a natural Duty that we owe to God, as Creatures to their Creator. Had God required the ſame Things of us that now he doth, and never propounded a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to incourage us, he had been juſt and we had been as abſolutely and as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſably obliged to obey as now we are. We have not ſo great a Right to Salvation, as God hath to our Obedience. God can challenge our Service and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience from us, becauſe of our natural Bond and Obligation, as well as from
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:109965:44"/>
that voluntary Covenant where into we have entred with God to be Obedient; but we can only plead for Salvation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God hath made a Promiſe that he will ſave thoſe that Obey. Whether God had made that Promiſe or not, yet he might have required the ſame Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience from us that now he doth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we owe it to him naturally by our Creation. And is it not now free Grace and Mercy, that when God might have required Obedience without a Reward, that yet he will beſtow Salvation ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that Obedience? See what our <hi>Saviour</hi> ſaith in <hi>Luke</hi> 17.<note place="margin">

                           <hi>Doth the Maſter thank the Servant becauſe he did the things that he was commanded to do? I trow not. So even ye likewiſe, when you have done all thoſe things that are commanded you, ſay, we are unprofitable Servants; for when we have done all, we have but done that which was our Duty to do.</hi> Yea, and our Duty it was to do it, though God had never made a Promiſe to reward what we have done.

                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> Our Obedience is imperfect in this Life, it is full of cracks and flaws: And if to accept and reward the moſt perfect Obedience with Salvation, be an Act of Mercy and free Grace, as it is, becauſe it is our Duty if there were no Salvation promiſed; how much more is free Grace magnified and glorified in accepting and rewarding a weak and imperfect Obedience with that Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which the moſt perfect Obedience cannot deſerve? <hi>For when we have done all, we have done but that which was our Duty to do; and if we could ſay ſo, doth the Maſter thank the Servant?

Now to reward that with eternal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, that deſerves eternal Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; to reward that Work with Life, that deſerves to be rewarded with Death, what is this but the effect of rich and glorious Grace?

God hath choſen us,</hi> there's Election; <hi>choſen us to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> there's the End. But how? <hi>through ſanctification of the Spirit, and belief of the Truth:</hi> Choſen us to Salvation as to the End, but it is not an End to be obtained without Sanctification. There is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed an abſolute <hi>Election</hi> to Salvation whereby God, without reſpect of Works, hath choſen ſome to Salvation; but there is no <hi>Election</hi> to Salvation ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute whereby God hath choſen any to Salvation without Works, that is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:109965:47"/>
they work or not. If therefore you believe heartily and obey ſincerely, then your <hi>Election</hi> to Salvation ſtands firm; nay, the <hi>Scripture</hi> makes <hi>Election</hi> to be terminated as well in <hi>Obedience</hi> as Salvation. <hi>Elect,</hi> ſays the <hi>Apoſtle, unto Obedience through ſanctification of the Spirit.</hi> In the former place it was, <hi>Elect to Salvation through Sanctification;</hi> but in this it is, <hi>Elect to Obedience through Sanctification:</hi> Noting thus much to us, That none are <hi>Elected</hi> to <hi>Salvation</hi> but thoſe that are <hi>Elected</hi> to <hi>Obedience;</hi> and therefore it is unreaſonable, yea, it is contradictory to ſay, If I am <hi>Elected</hi> I ſhall be ſaved whether I obey or not, for none are thereunto <hi>Elected</hi> but thro' Obedience.</p>
                        <p>And now having, as I hope, ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factorily Anſwer'd all Objections and Scruples that may ariſe in the Hearts of Men againſt this <hi>Doctrin,</hi> I now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to preſs this Duty of working for Salvation upon their Conſciences; and I ſhall do it in a Uſe of Exhortation.</p>
                        <p>Be perſwaded then, <hi>Oh Sinners!</hi> to caſt off your Sloth and Lazineſs, and to rouſe your ſelves from that drowſy

Slumber that you have long lain in, and to work for Salvation. But truly when I conſider how powerful an <hi>Orator,</hi> and how mighty a <hi>Charmer</hi> Sloth is; how eaſily it can ſtupify and benumb <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and lull Men aſleep on the top of a <hi>Maſt,</hi> and on the brinks of <hi>Hell;</hi> and though God and Man call upon them, <hi>Sinners, Sinners,</hi> beſtir your ſelves, work for your Lives, you periſh eternally if you do not labour to lay hold on eternal Life, for you are falling, and <hi>Hell-fire</hi> is under you: Yet truly when we call and cry thus earneſtly, how eaſily can a careleſs, yawning, wretched Sinner, ſlight all theſe Admonitions, baffle all theſe Arguments, Motives and Perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, though urged upon them with all vehemency and tenderneſs of Affection that can be, and turn about like a Man beſotted falling faſt aſleep again? When I conſider this, truly I am apt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that it is but a deſperate attempt to preſs Men any more againſt their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and againſt ſo many Diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages that can ſoon fruſtrate the Effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of weaker Words, and to give over in Deſpair with that of the Prophet, <hi>He that will be Righteous, let him be Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous; and he that will be Wicked, let him

And yet truly, if variety of Motives, if Strength of Arguments and Perſuaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons would prevail, we might hope for this ſeldom-ſeen Succeſs; why then let us conſider theſe following Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>

To work for Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is a great and weighty Work.</note>Firſt, <hi>Conſider Sinners, you have a great and weighty Work to do, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is time, yea, high time that you were up and doing.</hi> Believe it Sirs, God hath not placed you here in this World, as the <hi>Leviathan</hi> in the great Waters, only to play and ſport; were it ſo, you might take your Eaſe, hold your Arms in your Boſoms, and follow your Delights and Pleaſures; and let him be blam'd that ever ſhould diſturb or diſcourage you

I know not whether ſome may not think that we <hi>Miniſters</hi> are <hi>Task-Maſters,</hi> and that we make more ado than needs. No, Sirs, it is God that hath ſet you your Work; we do only tell you how great it is, and of how great concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it is to you that it be done; and if you will not do it who can help it? We have no <hi>Scourges</hi> or <hi>Scorpions</hi> to drive you to your Work, but God hath to puniſh you if you neglect it; and why is it ſo generally neglected, but becauſe Men do not ſeriouſly conſider how great it is. Moſt Men acknowledg that it muſt be done; but becauſe they look upon it as that which may ſpeedily and quickly be diſpatched, they drive it before them from Day to Day, and think to huddle it up at the end of their Lives: Then when they are fit for no other Imployment, and leaſt of all fit for this Imployment, then they think to do the Works of God. I ſhall here lay down three Particulars to convince Sinners of the greatneſs of this Work, and becauſe it is ſo great a Work, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires that they ſhould preſently, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out delay, ſet upon it.</p>
                        <p>

                           <note place="margin">1. Working for Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the undoing our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Works.</note>
                           <hi>First,</hi> It is a Work in which Sinners muſt undo all that they have wrought in their whole Lives before. <hi>Oh Sinner,</hi> think what haſt thou been doing this twenty, thirty, forty Years or more! Haſt thou not inſtead of working out thine own Salvation with Fear and Trembling, been working out thine own Condemnation without Fear or Trembling? Haſt thou not been work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Works of Darkneſs? Haſt thou not been <hi>working the Works of thy Father the Devil,</hi> as our Saviour tells the <hi>Jews?</hi> Truly this is not ſo much working as making of Work; all this muſt be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done again, or you your ſelves muſt be for ever undone; you muſt unrip and unravel your whole Lives by a deep and bitter Repentance; you are gone far in the way that leads to Death and Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and you muſt tread back every Step, and at every Step ſhed many ſalt and briny Tears before ever you come into the Way that leads to Life and Happineſs; and is it not yet time to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin? Can the Work of ſo many Years be undone, think you, in one moment? No, <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Satan</hi> make their Works more durable and laſting, than to be ſo
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:109965:49"/>
eaſily and ſpeedily ſpoiled. It were the Work of an Age, yea, of Eternity it ſelf if poſſibly we could ſo ſpend it, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than of a few faint late Thoughts, to get an Humiliation deep enough, and a Sorrow ſad enough, to bear any the leaſt proportion to any of the leaſt Sins that we have committed: Do not hope or think that your many great and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Actions ſhall ever be blown away with a ſlight and general Confeſſion; or that ever they ſhall be waſh'd away with a ſlight and overly Repentance. What ſays holy <hi>David?</hi>

                           <hi>Thou telleſt my Wanderings, put thou my Tears into thy Bottle.</hi> Thou haſt my Wandrings by Number, but thou haſt alſo my Tears by Meaſure. There muſt be ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion betwixt the Humiliation and the Sins; great Sins call for great Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and long continuance in Sin re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a continued and prolonged Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. Is it not then yet high time to begin? Have you not already made Work enough for your whole Lives, ſhould they be longer than they are like to be? Nay, and will not every Day of your Lives make Work enough for it ſelf? What ſays our Saviour?<note place="margin">Mat. 8.34.</note> 
                           <hi>Sufficient for the day is the evil thereof.</hi> Truly the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:109965:50"/>
Evils that we every Day commit, is ſufficient Work for the Sorrow and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance of that Day to undo. Now then begin this undoing Work; the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger you delay, ſtill the more will lie up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your Hands, ſtill the more Sins you have to repent of. We already com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, That the Work God hath ſet us is too hard and too grievous, and yet ſuch fooliſh Creatures are we that we make it more and more difficult by our Delays, adding to the ſtrictneſs of Gods Commands the neceſſity of a ſevere Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. And therefore it is Prudence, as well as Duty, to begin this repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, this undoing Work betimes, that ſo the greatneſs of the Work, and the ſhortneſs of the time to do it in, may not at laſt diſmay and confound us.</p>

                           <note place="margin">2. Variety of Duties to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd in working out of Salvation.</note>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> Conſider the great variety of Duties that muſt be gone through in the working out of Salvation, and this will evince how great a Work it is. A Chriſtian's Work is a Life full of Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Imployments, there ſhould be no gap nor void ſpace at all in it, but all ſhould be filled up with Duties ranked in their ſeveral Orders, that as ſoon as he paſſeth through one he ſhould enter
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:109965:50"/>
upon another, that where one leaves him another may find him. Thus a Chriſtian ſhould go from one Duty to another; from hearing the Word to Meditation, from Meditation unto Prayer, from Prayer to the acting of Grace, and in all there ſhould be much ſtriving and ſtrugling with the Heart, and much carefulneſs and circumſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction over the Way and Life.</p>
                        <p>Now there are <hi>Four</hi> great and uſual Duties every Man hath to do,<note place="margin">Four Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent on all Chriſtians</note> which is enough to fill up all the time of his Life, were it ſtretched and tenter'd out to the end of our time.</p>
                        <p>

                           <note place="margin">1. To get the Truth of Grace.</note> He is to get the Truth and Reality of Grace wrought in him; this is his firſt and general Work: And this will coſt a Man much Sweat and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, for this he muſt ſuffer many Pangs and Throws of the New Birth, and ſhall lye under many Fears and Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies, leſt Hypocriſy and Preſumption ſhould cauſe him to miſtake in a Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ſuch infinite Concernment.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> He is to draw forth,<note place="margin">2. To act Grace.</note> and to act this Grace when once it is wrought
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:109965:51"/>
in him. This is the next Work of a true Chriſtian, continually to act Faith, Love, Patience, Humility, and to let all have their perfect Work: And there is no moment of a Man's Life ſo idle, but all may adminiſter ſome Occaſion or Object for the exerciſe of Grace.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">3. To grow in Grace.</note>
                           <hi>Thirdly,</hi> A Chriſtian's next Work is continually to grow and increaſe in Grace: <hi>To go from Strength to Strength, to be changed from Glory to Glory.</hi> Still to be adding Cubits to his ſpiritual Stature, till he is grown to ſuch a height and tall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in Grace, that his Head ſhall reach into Heaven and be Crowned there in abſolute Perfection, with a Crown of Glory and Immortality. Here is that Work that will keep you in Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment all your Days; and if you can find one ſpare minute in your whole Lives wherein you have not ſome Duty to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, then give over and ſit ſtill. But beſides all this,</p>

a Chriſtian muſt be aſcending, aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from a probable Conjecture to a good Perſuaſion, from a good Perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to a full Aſſurance, from that to a Rejoycing with Joy unſpeakable and full of Glory.

                        <p>For ſhame then, O Chriſtians, ſince that your Work is ſo great, why will you ſit ſtill as if you knew not how to imploy your ſelves? Beſides, there is great variety in your Work, and this uſually breeds ſome kind of Delight. You are not always to be toiling and drudging at the ſame thing: But as <hi>Bees</hi> fly from one Flower to another and ſuck ſweetneſs from each of them; ſo ſhould a Chriſtian paſs from one Duty to another, and draw forth the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Communion with God from every one of them.</p>
                        <p>

                           <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To evince the greatneſs of this Work, conſider it is a Work that muſt be carried on againſt many En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters and ſtrong Oppoſitions that a Chriſtian will certainly meet with; within are ſtrong Corruptions, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out are ſtrong Temptations; you have a treacherous and deceitful Heart with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and this Traitor holds Intelligence and League with your great Enemy the Devil without: You are ſure to meet with Difficulties, Affronts and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements from a peeviſh ill-condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, World in which you live: Never any yet could ſcape free to Heaven with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out meeting with theſe Things. And doth not all this call upon you to work and ſtrive for Salvation? Is it a time to ſit ſtill when you have all this Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to break through, ſo many Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations to reſiſt, ſo many Corruptions to mortify, <hi>Satan</hi> that <hi>old Serpent</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and make him become a <hi>flying Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent?</hi> Doth not all this require a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe Conſtancy, and a kind of ſour Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolvedneſs to go thorough the ways of Obedience, notwithſtanding all Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Theſe great Things are not to be atchieved without great Pains and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour;
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:109965:52"/>
and therefore, if you reſolve to do no more than a few heartleſs Wiſhes, no more than a few more heartleſs Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties will amount to, never raiſe your Expectations ſo high as Salvation; for let me tell you, Salvation will not be obtained at ſuch a rate as this; no, there muſt be great Struglings and Labour, with earneſt Contendings, if ever you intend to be ſaved.</p>
                        <p>And thus much for the <hi>firſt Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> taken from the conſideration of the greatneſs of the Work: To work Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion out is a great Work and requireth great Pains. But leſt the ſetting out the greatneſs of this Work, ſhould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deter and fright Men from it than excite and quicken their Endeavours to it, let me add a ſecond Thing;</p>
                        <p>And that is to conſider what an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite,<note place="margin">2. It is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy that Sinners may work for Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</note> incomparable Mercy it is that God will allow you to work for your Lives, that he ſets Life and Death be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you, and gives them into your Hands to take your Choice: If you will indulge your Sloth, then you chooſe Death; but Life may be yours if you will: It will indeed coſt you much Pains and Labour, but yet it may be
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:109965:53"/>
yours: And is it not infinite Mercy that Salvation and Happineſs may be yours, though upon any Terms? Wicked Men are apt to ſay, <hi>O how happy had we been if God had never commanded us to Work, if he had never required from us ſuch harſh and difficult Duties, if we were but once free from this hard Task and heavy Burden of Obedience!</hi> But alas! <hi>fooliſh Sinners,</hi> they know not what they ſay; as happy as they count this to be, yet if God requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red no working from them, he ſhould then ſhew them juſt ſo much Mercy as he doth to the Devils and damned Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and no more, from whom God requires no Duty as well as from whom he receives no Duty, and unto whom he intends no Mercy. You think it a hard Reſtraint poſſibly, to be kept un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſtrict Commands of the Law: Oh! that God required no ſuch Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervances from you. But what do you deſire herein but only the unhappy Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of the Damned, to be without Law and without Commands? But ſhould God ſend to the Spirits now im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſon'd, and ſhould he declare to them, that if they would Work they ſhould be ſaved, oh! how would they leap in their Chains at ſuch glad Tidings as
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:109965:53"/>
theſe are, and count it part of Salvation that there was but a poſſibility of it. No, but God commands nothing from them, becauſe he intends nothing but Wrath upon them; he will not vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe ſo much Mercy to them as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire thoſe Duties from them, that you repine and murmur at as grievous. And furthermore conſider this, if you do not now work, but periſh under your Sloth, in <hi>Hell</hi> you will think it an infinite Mercy if God would command you more rigid and ſevere Obedience than ever he commanded from you on Earth: It would be a great Mercy there, if it might be your Duty to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and Pray, and Believe; nay, you would count a Command then to be as comfortable as a Promiſe; for indeed there is no Command but connotes a Promiſe: No, but theſe things ſhall not ſo much as be your Duty in <hi>Hell;</hi> for there you ſhall be freed for ever from this rigorous and dreadful Law of God, that now you ſo much complain of and murmur againſt. Oh! therefore be perſuaded while you are yet under the Mercy of the Law, (give me leave to call it ſo) and while you have ſo many Promiſes couched in every Command,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:109965:54"/>
before God hath left off his merciful Commanding, before the time of Duty be expired, be perſuaded to Work: De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay not, you know not how long God will vouchſafe to require any thing from you; and as ſoon as that ceaſeth, truly you are in Hell. And this is the ſecond Argument to preſs this Duty upon you. Work, and that ſpeedily too; while you may Work there is hope that upon your working you may be ſaved; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore while God calls upon you, and whilſt he will accept of Obedience from you, it is time for you to begin to work.</p>

Our Candle is light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and it is but ſmall at the beſt; and to how many of us is it already ſunk in the Socket, and brought to a Snuff? and how ſoon the Breath of God may blow it out, neither you nor I know. Night is haſtning upon us, the Grave expects us, and bids other Corpſes make room for us: Death is ready to graſp us in its cold Arms and to carry us before God's Tribunal; and, alas, how little of our great Work is done! What can any ſhew that they have done? Where are the actings of Faith, the labour of Love, the perfect Works of Patience? Where are thoſe Graces that are either begotten or increaſed? Where are the Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that you have mortify'd? Theſe are Works that require Ages to perform them in, and yet you neglect them that have but a few Days, nay, poſſibly but a few Minutes to do them in.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>No, far be it from us to ſay thus: Though our Work be great, yet our Time is long enough to perform it in, if it were well improved. We do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed conſume away our precious Days,

and waſte our Life and Light, exhauſt our Strength, and lay out our Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours upon Vanities and Trifles, on nothing but Emptineſs and Folly. And that Life which the <hi>Prophet</hi> tells us, <hi>is but as a Tale,</hi> truly we ſpend it as a <hi>Dream:</hi> We ſleep and drowſe, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer our precious Minutes to run and waſte away doing nothing to any good purpoſe, till the Night is ſhutting in, till the Night of Darkneſs come upon us, and then the greatneſs of our Work will confound us, and cauſe Deſpair ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than excite Endeavours. Have you never known any who at the cloſe of their Lives, having neglected their great Work, have ſpent that little time that they had then left them, in crying out for more time?

<pb n="83" facs="tcp:109965:55"/>
they would but lay it to Heart: My Time is but ſhort and momentany, I am but of Yeſterday, and poſſibly I may not be to Morrow, and God hath ſuſpended <hi>Eternity</hi> upon the Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this moment; a few Hours will determine my everlaſting State and Condition; according as theſe few are ſpent, ſo will my Doom be, either for <hi>Eternal Happineſs</hi> or for <hi>Eternal Miſery.</hi> And why ſhould my precious Soul be ſo vile in my own Eyes, as to loſe it for ever through Sloth and Negligence? Why ſhould I hearken to the Allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of my own Corruptions, or to the Enticements and Perſuaſions of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi> Temptations? No, ſtand off, for I am working for <hi>Eternity,</hi> an <hi>Eternity</hi> that is but a few Days hence, a bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, a bottomleſs, an endleſs <hi>Eternity,</hi> into which I know not how ſoon I may enter; and Woe to me, yea, a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Woes to me that ever I was born, if my great Work be not done before the Days of <hi>Eternity</hi> come upon me. This is ſuch a Motive as methinks ſhould make every Man that hears it, and hath but a ſenſe what <hi>Eternity</hi> is, preſently to beſtir and rouſe up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and give God and his Soul no reſt
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:109965:56"/>
till his Immortal Soul be ſecured, and well provided for, for <hi>Eternity.</hi> To me there is no greater Argument of the Witchcraft and Sorcery that Sin and Satan uſeth to beſot the Reaſon and Judgment of rational Creatures, than to hear of ſuch Truths, Truths that are not to be denied or doubted of, and yet Men to live at ſuch a rate as they do, ſo vainly, ſo fruitleſsly, ſo lazily, ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely and preſumptuouſly, as if their <hi>Eternity</hi> were to be expected and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed here, or that there was none to come hereafter.</p>

                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> The conſideration of the ſhortneſs of our Life, may ſerve as a great Incouragement to work. The conſideration of the burthenſomneſs and trouble of working for Salvation may doubtleſs fright many from engaging therein; Oh! it is a Work very pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and laborious, and this diſcourageth them. But know, <hi>O Sinner!</hi> though it be grievous, yet it is but ſhort Work; it is to laſt no longer than our frail, ſhort Life doth laſt: And O! how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable is it to complain, as moſt do, of our Work being too long and too te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious; and of our Lives, as being too
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:109965:56"/>
ſhort and brittle? for our Work is to be no longer than our Lives. A Child of God doth not, at leaſt he ſhould not, deſire to live longer than his great Work is done: And truly when it is finiſhed, it is a great piece of <hi>Self-denial</hi> in him to be content to abide here in this World any longer: And in the mean while this may ſupport him, that it ſhall not be long that he ſhall thus wreſtle with Temptations, and thus ſtruggle with Corruptions: <hi>Death</hi> will come in to his Help, and put an end to his Toil and Labour; and though he brings a Dart in one Hand, yet he brings a Reward and Wages in the other Hand; and this may be his great Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Fourthly,</hi> My next Argument to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> preſs this Duty of working out of our own Salvation, ſhall conſiſt of three or four Gradations. And,</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>First,</hi> Conſider, we are all of us very buſy, active Creatures;<note place="margin">1. We are all buſy, active Creatures</note> the frame and conſtitution of our Natures is ſuch as we muſt be working ſome Work or other: And therefore ſince we muſt be working, why ſhould we not work
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:109965:57"/>
the Works of God? We do not ſimply exhort Sinners to work, neither indeed need we: You have active Faculties and ſtirring Principles within you, that muſt and will be ſtill in Imployment; and when your Hands ceaſe, yet then your Hearts and Thoughts are at work: Your whole Lives are nothing but Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; yea, when your Thoughts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are moſt unbent and moſt remiſs, when they are moſt vaniſhing and glim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering, ſo that your ſelves ſcarce know what they are, yet then are they viſibly working, though you perceive it not. Now what is it that God requires of you? It is not that you ſhould be more imployed than you are, that you ſhould do more than you do; for that is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, becauſe you never are idle do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing; but it is, that what you do ſhould be done in order unto Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Salvation; and how reaſonable is ſuch a Command as this? It is not more Work that God expects from you, only other Work; your Thoughts need not be more than they are, but they muſt be more Spiritual than they are; your Deſires no more, but only more Gracious; your Actions no more, but only they muſt be more Holy than
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:109965:57"/>
now they are: Let but Grace regulate what Nature doth, and the Art of working out of your Salvation is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. The Wheels of a Watch move as faſt and as quick when it goes falſe as when it goes true; and if the Watch be but at firſt ſet right and true, the ſame activity that makes it go falſe, will make the Motions go right and orderly: Truly you your ſelves are like your Watches; your Faculties are the Wheels of your Souls, and they move and click as faſt when they go falſe, as when they go right; and if Grace doth but once ſet them right, the ſame acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of Nature that makes them work falſly and go amiſs, will alſo continue their Motion orderly and regular when once they are ſet right. Well then, whatever your Trade be, whether it be a Trade of Sin, or whether it be a Trade of Holineſs, you muſt be work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at it. And let me tell you, Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Holineſs are ſo far from increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of your Work, that they rather leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen and contract it: What ſays our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour? <hi>Martha, Martha,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Luke 10.41.</note> 
                           <hi>thou art care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful about many things; but one thing is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.</hi> So may I ſay; <hi>Sinners,</hi> you are careful and buſy your ſelves about many
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:109965:58"/>
things, but there is but one thing that is neceſſary; many things indeed you trouble your ſelves with, the Cares of the World, the Temptations of Satan, the Corruptions of your own Hearts, theſe diſtract you, yea, very Trifles and Impertinencies themſelves give you full Imployment; this Luſt ſtorms and rageth, that Luſt flatters and enticeth; this is impetuous, that is inſinuating; the one impells, the other allures; and it may be after all, Conſcience begins to grow terrible, giving the Sinner no quiet in doing of that which Luſt would let him have no reſt till he had done: So that betwixt them, of all Mens Lives in the World his is the moſt toilſome and vexatious. Since then you can ſave no Labour by being as you are, why will you not change your Work? You are now in conſtant Imployment as you are, and no more is required of you in the ways of <hi>Obedience;</hi> nay, you are now divided, diſtracted and even torn in pieces, betwixt divers Luſts and Pleaſures, all which cry <hi>give, give,</hi> and all are eager and importunate, ſo that you know not which to turn to firſt. But in working for Salvation your Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment is but the one thing neceſſary,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:109965:58"/>
which though indeed it calls for the ſame Endeavours and Induſtry which now you uſe in the Service of Sin, yet by reaſon of its Uniformity, is leſs di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractive and leſs cumberſome: And that is the firſt Gradation.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> Conſider this,<note place="margin">2. All Men work ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Gods Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice or the Devils Drudgery.</note> 
                           <hi>You muſt work either in Gods Service, or in the Devils Drudgery:</hi> And chooſe you whether you had rather be Satan's Slaves, or God's Servants; nay, indeed chooſe whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Is it a matter of Choice with Men, who have rational and immortal Souls? Do you not all profeſs your ſelves to be the Servants of the living God? Do you not all wear his Livery? Would not the vileſt and moſt profligate Sinner willingly lurk under the Name and Badge of a Chriſtian, and count it a great Wrong done him, ſhould any ſo much as doubt of his Salvation? And wherefore is this, but becauſe they are aſhamed of their Service, and of their own black Maſter? But alas! it is in vain to renounce him in Words; for if your Works be not for God, if they be not ſuch as Religion exacts, as the Holy Ghoſt inſpires, as Grace performs, and as Salvation calls for from you, his
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:109965:59"/>
Slaves you are, and though you profeſs to deny him, yet in your Works you own him.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">3. Thoſe that work for Satan, work for their own Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note>Thirdly, <hi>If you work for Satan you do but work for your own Damnation:</hi> For work you muſt and will, and this is all the Reward and Wages that you can juſtly expect from the Service of Sin and <hi>Satan;</hi> and of this a juſt God and a mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious <hi>Devil</hi> will look that you ſhall not be defrauded; but as your <hi>Ephah</hi> hath been full of Iniquity and Abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſo ſhall your <hi>Cup</hi> be full of Wrath and Indignation. Think, <hi>Oh Sinner,</hi> think how theſe Maſters, whom thou now ſerveſt, will in <hi>Hell</hi> inſult over thee and upbraid thee. Is this he our faithful and induſtrious Servant? He, who preferred our Miſery before his own Happineſs, whoſe precious Soul was not precious to him for our ſakes? And is he now come whither his ways lead him? Prepare a Place quickly for him; let his <hi>Darkneſs</hi> be horrid and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, his Works were ſo; let his <hi>Chains</hi> be ſtrong and maſſy, the Bonds of his Iniquities were ſo; let his <hi>unquenchable Fire</hi> be piercing and vehement; let his <hi>Torment</hi> be next unto my ſelf; this, this
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:109965:59"/>
will be the inſulting of your Maſter then. <hi>Oh Sinners</hi> conſider! Is this the Reward and Preferment that you work for? God forbid, Mercy prevent, you will ſay; nay believe it, Mercy will not prevent, God will not forbid, unleſs you your ſelves labour to prevent it; all this muſt be your Condemnation as unavoidably as if God had no ſuch At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute of Mercy belonging to his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. This Sinners know, and are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded of the Truth of it, unleſs they are <hi>Atheiſts;</hi> and if you are, truly it will not be long before your own Senſe and Feeling will convince you of the Truth of theſe things, to your eternal Grief and Sorrow: And if you do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve this, why do you not rowſe up your ſelves and fall to work? If you are reſolved for <hi>Hell,</hi> for a foreſeen and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warned <hi>Hell,</hi> who then can ſtop you? And unleſs you are reſolved for <hi>Hell,</hi> methinks I might have done and need proceed no further. Tell me therefore, <hi>Oh Sinners,</hi> are you not all perſuaded by theſe Terrors? Will you not from this moment labour, and ſtruggle, and ſtrive, and take any Pains in the ways of Obedience, rather than ruin your own Souls, and thruſt them down into
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:109965:60"/>
the Pit of Deſtruction? I might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident <hi>Sinners</hi> thus reſolve to do, were I ſpeaking now to Men that were them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.

Now Sinners, ſince the work of Sin is ſo toil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, why will you not <hi>work the Works of God?</hi> Doth that Salvation that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows Obedience fright you, or is Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Glory become terrible to you? Is not this it that all Men deſire? Do not your Hearts leap at the mention of it? What then is it that any rational Man can pretend, why he will not work? Is it becauſe you are loth to take Pains? Why then are you ſo labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in Sinning? Why do you ſo ſweat and toil in carrying Faggots to your own Fire? Why are you continually blowing up thoſe Flames that ſhall for ever burn you? It is in vain to plead this any longer that you are loth to take Pains; for where are there greater Drudges in all the World than Sinners are? The <hi>Devil</hi> can ſcarce find them Work enough, they out-ſin his Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;

And ſometimes they are more reſtleſs and impatient when they have done it, through the <hi>Devils</hi> Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations; and yet, notwithſtanding theſe Torments, they will do them again. Are there now more Drudges in the World than theſe are? Doth God require more Pains in his Service than theſe Men take? No, he doth not: Would but Men do as much for their precious Souls, as they do againſt them; would they do as much to ſave them, as they do to deſtroy and damn them; truly their Salvation would not lie up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Hands unwrought off.</p>

                           <hi>But ſome may ſay in their Hearts, It is true indeed we are convinced that the Work of Sin is laborious, but yet there is pleaſure in that labour: But to the Works of Obedience we find reluctancy, and to ſtruggle against that is exceeding irkſome

and grievous, and therefore we cannot work.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But is it ſo indeed? Is it all Peace and Tranquility with you when you ſin?

God requires no more Labour from you than you now take; nay, this Labour ſhall not put you to ſo much Torment as ſometimes you now feel: The ſame Labour, with more content and ſatisfaction, may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect your Salvation, that now tends on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to conſummate your Deſtruction. What Madneſs then is it for Men not to be perſuaded to <hi>work the Works of God,</hi> when it will coſt them leſs Pains, I mean leſs tormenting Pains?

                           <hi>Seventhly,</hi> Conſider this: <hi>Are you am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious? Do you affect true Honour and Dignity?

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:109965:64"/>
for Salvation is the moſt honourable Imployment in the World, an Honour that will poſe and nonplus the moſt towring and raiſed <hi>Ambition,</hi> when once it is ſpiritualized. Alas, what poor and contemptible Things are the Grandees and great Ones of the World, though they take great State and Pomp upon them, and will ſcarce own their Inferiours for their Fellow-Creatures; nay, will ſcarce own God himſelf for their Superiour, are yet but like painted <hi>Flies</hi> that play and buz a while in the Sun-ſhine, and then moulder away and come to nothing? All worldly Honour and Pomp is but imaginary; but would you have that which is ſolid and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial? Chriſt tells you how it is to be attained. <hi>If any Man ſerve me,</hi>

                           <hi>him will my Father honour.</hi> Whatever Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour we have, we hold it by Service; our Work is not only Duty, but Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment alſo: If any Man ſerve me, he ſhall be honoured.

Would you be <hi>Peers</hi> of that Kingdom with <hi>Saints</hi> and glorified <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels?</hi> Then honour God. And how ſhall you honour him, but by obeying him? And he who thus honours God,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:109965:65"/>
God will honour him. This is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly real Honour, all other is but airy, fictitious Titles; like <hi>Cyphers,</hi> which as they are placed, ſtand for Hundreds and Thouſands, but are all of the ſame Value when hudled together. So truly the great Ones of the World, if not made honourable by Obedience to God, have but imaginary Excellency; and when <hi>Death</hi> once ſhuffles and huddles them together, <hi>Nobles</hi> with <hi>Ignobles,</hi> will the Duſt and Aſhes of the one ſtand at a Diſtance and make Obeyſance to the other? No, all Honour here ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies no more than a <hi>King</hi> upon a <hi>Stage.</hi> But here is a way to attain true Honour, here is the way to it by becoming Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,<note place="margin">Wherein the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of working for Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts.</note> not to Command, but to Obey; not to be imperious over others, but to work your ſelves; this is true Honour. Now I ſhall in three Things demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the Honour of working for Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that if Men be not very lowly ſpirited, they may be excited unto this honourable Work.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">1. It is a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and pure Work</note>Firſt, <hi>It is pure, ſpiritual, refined Work.</hi> In Services among Men, the leſs of Filth and Drudgery there is in them, the more creditable they are accounted.
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:109965:65"/>
It is an Honour to be imploy'd in higher and more cleanly Work, when others are buſied about baſer Imployments. Now, Chriſtians, your Work is the higheſt and moſt noble Service imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable; you are not at all to ſet your Hands to any foul Office; you have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do with that Mire and Sink in which wicked Men are raking, yea, and it is their Work to do it; no, but your Work is all ſpiritual, conſiſting of the ſame pure Imployment that the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi> in Heaven ſpend their Eternity about: <hi>Holy Thoughts, divine Affections, heavenly Meditations, ſpiritual Duties,</hi> in theſe lies your Work, which becauſe of its Purity is therefore very honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>

Glory in the higheſt Heavens, about which <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>glorified Saints</hi> are the Attendants; and his Throne of Grace to which you are called. <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Saints</hi> are but your Fellow-Attendants; and if they ſee his Glory in the higheſt Exaltation, you are admitted to ſee it in the next degree; yea, and herein is your Honour ſo great, that you are capable but of one Preferment more, and that is of being removed from one Throne to the other, from attending upon the Throne of Grace to attend upon the Throne of Glory, ſo great is your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">3. The Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God makes us his Friends.</note>Thirdly, <hi>Your Work is ſuch as makes you not ſo much Servants, as Friends unto God.</hi> It is an Honour to be Servant unto a King, but much more of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to become a Favourite.

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:109965:66"/>
you do whatſoever I command you.</hi> And certainly no Title ſo truly glorious as that which God put upon <hi>Abraham, To be the Friend of God.</hi> Well then, let wicked Men go on ſcoffing and mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Obedience in the People of God, let them look on them as poor and low ſpirited Perſons, yet can there be no Honour like unto theirs, to be Attendants upon, yea, the Friends of the great God of Heaven; and there can be no Diſcredit ſo baſe as theirs who are Slaves to the Devil, who is Gods Slave; to be a Slave unto the Devil, whom the People of God have in part ſubdued and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and over whom they ſhall ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at once perfectly triumph.</p>
                        <p>And now having thus, by ſeveral Arguments, preſt this great Duty of working out of our own Salvation, I ſhould now proceed to ſome other Things that are neceſſary to be ſpoken unto from this Doctrin: But becauſe this is a Duty of ſo vaſt Importance, and of ſo univerſal Concernment unto all, and the Slothfulneſs and Backward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of many ſo great, and if per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in, will be ſo ruinous and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, I ſhall further urge the practice
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:109965:67"/>
of this Duty upon the Conſciences of Sinners, by theſe following Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">1. Working for Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful Work.</note>Firſt, <hi>This working for Salvation is the moſt delightful Work and Imployment that a Chriſtian can be engaged in.</hi> What is it that makes the whole World ſo buſy in the Service of Sin and Satan, but only Pleaſure which they either find or imagine? The <hi>Devil</hi> baits all his Temptations with this enticing Witchcraft, which the World calls Pleaſure, and this is that makes them ſo ſucceſsful. But hath the <hi>Devil</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſed all Pleaſure unto his Service? Can the Ways of God promiſe no De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light? Are they only ruff and rugged Ways? <hi>David</hi> certainly thought other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, when ſpeaking of the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God,<note place="margin">Pſalm 19.10.</note> he tell us, <hi>They were ſweeter than the Hony and the Hony-comb.</hi> He could ſqueeze Hony out of them; it is an Expreſſion that ſets forth the exceeding Pleaſantneſs and Delight that is to be found in the ways of Obedience. And truly the whole <hi>Book of Pſalms</hi> is abundantly copious in ſetting forth that Delight that is to be found in the ways of God. Ask therefore the Children
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:109965:67"/>
of God, who are the only ſufficient Judges in this Matter, and they will tell you with one Conſent, that they know no Delight on Earth comparable to that Delight that is to be found in Obedience. Indeed if you are only taken with a ſoft, luxurious, waſhy Pleaſure, this is not to be found in the ways of Holineſs; but if a ſevere De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light can affect you, a Delight that ſhall not effeminate but innoble you; if you deſire a maſculine, rational, vigorous Pleaſure and Delight, you need not ſeek any further for it than in the ways of Obedience.</p>
                        <p>Now there are two Things that make this working for Salvation to be ſo pleaſant;<note place="margin">Two Things make working for Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant.</note> the ſuitableneſs of this Work to the Agent or Worker, and the viſible Succeſs and Progreſs of the Work it ſelf: And both theſe make the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of Salvation exceeding pleaſant and delightful to the People of God.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>First,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">1. Suitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Work to the Agent</note> It is a Work ſuited to their Natures, and that makes it pleaſant. As Jeſus Chriſt had in a phiſical Senſe, ſo every true Chriſtian hath in a moral Senſe two Natures in one Perſon:
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:109965:68"/>
There is the divine Nature or the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God, and there is the humane, corrupt Nature, the Nature of ſinful Man, and each of theſe have Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſuited unto them; there is the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal part, and that is too apt to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced and drawn away with the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Sin, that are Objects proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned to the carnal part: But then there is alſo a divine, and if I may ſo call it, a ſupernatural Nature, imprinted by Regeneration, that only doth reliſh hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly and ſpiritual Things: So that it is not more natural to a godly Man by reaſon of the Propenſions of the old Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to ſin againſt God, than it is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to him, by reaſon of the Propenſions of the new Nature, to obey and ſerve God. Now when Nature acts ſuitably to its own ſway and <hi>pondus,</hi> this muſt needs cauſe two Things: Firſt, <hi>Facility and Eaſineſs:</hi> Secondly, <hi>Delight and Complacency.</hi> Streams flow from the Fountain with eaſe, becauſe they take but their natural Courſe. So the Works of Obedience flow eaſily from that Fountain Principle of Grace that is broken up in the Hearts of the Children of God, becauſe they flow naturally from them; and therefore becauſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:109965:68"/>
makes things eaſie, that eaſineſs will make them pleaſant and delightful. It is true indeed when they work, there is an oppoſition and reluctancy from their other contrary Nature; for as they act ſuitably to the one, ſo they act quite contrary to the other Nature: But doth not the gracious and new Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as ſtrongly wreſtle againſt and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Workings and Eruptions of the old Nature, as the old doth the Workings of the new? Yes, it doth; and therefore you that are truly Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, never ſin becauſe of the eaſineſs of it, becauſe of its ſuitableneſs, becauſe elſe you muſt offer violence to your Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture if you reſiſt a Temptation. Do you not offer violence to your Nature if you cloſe with that Temptation? You are not all of one piece, if I may ſo ſpeak, if you are Regenerate. And what? muſt the corrupt part only be indulged and gratified, and muſt the renewed part be always oppoſed? Why ſhould not Grace, ſince it is as much, nay, more your ſelf than Sin is, why ſhould not that have the ſame ſcope and liberty to act freely as Sin doth? Truly theſe Things are Riddles to wicked Men, and they are unfit Judges in this Caſe;
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:109965:69"/>
they wonder what we mean when we ſpeak of Eaſineſs and Delight in ways of Obedience, which they never found to be otherwiſe than the moſt burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Thing in the World. And truly it is no wonder, for they have no Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple ſuited to theſe Things, they are made up only of the old Nature, that is as contrary and repugnant to them as Darkneſs is to Light. But if once God renew and ſanctifie them, then they will confeſs as we do, that the Works of God have more eaſineſs in them than the generality of the World do ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine; and therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells, <hi>That he delighted in the Law of God after the inward Man.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Rom. 7.22.</note> But why after the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Man? But becauſe though his corrupt part was contrary thereunto, yet his renewed part, which he calls his inward Man, was ſuited to the Duties of the Law of God, and carried him out as naturally to Obedience as the Spark flies upward. And hence it is that the Children of God delight in the ways of Obedience, becauſe they ſuit with their new Nature that is implanted in them.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="111" facs="tcp:109965:69"/>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">2. Progreſs in working for Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion makes it pleaſant.</note> Another Thing that makes working for Salvation ſo delightful, is, <hi>That viſible Succeſs that the Children of God gain, and that viſible progreſs that they make in this Work.</hi> Nothing doth uſually cauſe greater Delight in Work than to ſee ſome riddance in it, and that we are like at length to bring it to ſome iſſue. So truly this is that which migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily delights the Children of God to ſee that their Work goes forward, that their Graces thrive, that their Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons pine and conſume away, that they are much nearer Salvation than when they firſt believed, that they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting Holineſs in the fear of God, and every Day growing nearer unto Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Happineſs than other: And though theſe Works of theirs are now imperfect, yet they ſhall be ſhortly fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed and conſummate in Glory.</p>
                        <p>Well then, if Pleaſure and Delight do affect you, here you ſee is that which is ſolid and ſubſtantial; it ſprings from Succeſs in your Work, and from that ſuitableneſs that is in your renewed part thereunto alſo. And therefore the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:109965:70"/>
more Work, the greater Delight you find; becauſe the greater progreſs you make, and the more ſuitable to it your Will becomes. Nay, your Delight is of the ſame Nature with that which you ſhall enjoy in Heaven: The Work the Bleſſed are there imploy'd in is of the ſame Nature with yours; only their ſuitableneſs to it is perfect, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Delight and Pleaſure is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: And accordingly the more ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able your Hearts are to your Work, the more Delight and Pleaſure you will find in it. This is that makes Heaven a place of Happineſs becauſe there is no Corruption, no Body of Sin and Death there to make thoſe Duties that are there required from glorified Saints to be irkſom and grievous to them.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">2. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of working for Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note>Secondly, <hi>Conſider the exceeding great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of your Reward. Doth</hi> Job <hi>fear God for nought,</hi> was the Cavil of <hi>Satan,</hi> when God applauded himſelf that he had ſuch a Servant as <hi>Job</hi> was upon the Earth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The <hi>Devil</hi> himſelf thought it no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that <hi>Job</hi> ſhould fear and ſerve a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding God, a God whoſe Hands are as full of Bleſſings as his Mouth is full
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:109965:70"/>
of Commands: And yet what were theſe great Somethings that the <hi>Devil</hi> envies <hi>Job</hi> for (and thinks every one would have done as much as he, if they had but as great a Recompence for it)? It was but <hi>Hedging of him about,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Job 1.10.</note> 
                           <hi>but bleſſing of the Works of his Hands, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing of his Subſtance,</hi> as it is in <hi>Job</hi> 1. Why, alas! theſe are poor mean <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi> to what God intends to beſtow; ſuch Rewards they are as that God ſtill reckons himſelf in Arrears to his Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, till he hath given them ſomething better than he can beſtow upon them here upon Earth: Theſe Things he caſts but as <hi>Crumbs</hi> unto <hi>Dogs,</hi> when he reſerves a far better Portion for his Children. And yet <hi>Satan</hi> thinks <hi>Job</hi> well paid for his Service in having of theſe lower Enjoyments, in cauſing the Works of his Hands to proſper; <hi>Doth Job ſerve God for nought?</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if <hi>Satan</hi> doth not wonder that <hi>Job fears</hi> and <hi>ſerves</hi> God for Temporal Mercies, will it not be to the great wonder of <hi>Satan</hi> himſelf that you ſhould not <hi>fear</hi> and <hi>ſerve</hi> God, that have infinitely better Things promiſed to you than Temporal Mercies are?
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:109965:71"/>
Do you deſerve your Breath, in ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it ſome few Hours in Prayer? Or do you deſerve your plentiful Eſtate, by laying out ſome ſmall part of it for God? Why, to be able to Think or Speak, to enjoy Health and Strength, are ſuch Mercies, though outward Mercies, as can never be recompenced to God, although you ſhould think of nothing but of his Glory, and ſpeak of nothing but of his Praiſe; although you ſhould impair your Health and waſte your Strength, and languiſh away in the performance of holy Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: Theſe, tho' they are Obligations to Obedience, yet they are not the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of Obedience; no, far higher and more glorious Things are provided, promiſed and ſhall be conferred upon you, if you will but work. For there is Firſt, your ſet ſtanding Wages, and that is eternal Salvation; no leſs. And Secondly, beſides this there are many incident Vails accrew to God's Servants, in their performance of his Service: And is not here Reward and Wages enough?</p>
                        <p>

                           <hi>First,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">1. Working for Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhall be reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Heaven. 1 Cor. 2.9.</note> Conſider <hi>there is that eternal weight of Glory that ſhall be the Reward of the Saints in Heaven.</hi> This now is ſo great that it is impoſſible for you to conceive: It is ſuch as <hi>Eye hath not ſeen, Ear hath not heard, nor hath it ever enter'd into, no nor can it ever enter into the Heart of Man to conceive what God hath prepared for them that love him,</hi> as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſpeaks. If St. <hi>Paul</hi> were now preaching and preſſing this very Conſideration of the infinite, glorious Reward, it would poſſibly be expected, that he who ſuffered a Tranſlation, and was admitted as a <hi>Spy</hi> into the <hi>Land</hi> of <hi>Promiſe,</hi> ſhould at his return make ſome Relation of it, and diſcover ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the Riches and Glory of that Place; and would not all flock about him, as Men do about <hi>Travellers,</hi> to enquire for a Deſcription of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try whence they come?

Thus inquiſitive truly our Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity would be. And yet when St. <hi>Paul</hi> purpoſely relates his <hi>Voyage</hi> to
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:109965:72"/>
the other World, all that he ſpeaks of it is only this, <hi>I knew a Man caught up into Paradiſe, who heard things that no Man could, nor is it lawful for any Man to utter.</hi> The Glory of Heaven is ſuch that it can never be fully known till it be fully enjoyed; and yet if Heaven were ever made chryſtally tranſparent to you, if ever God opened you a Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow into it, and then opened the Eye of your Faith to look in by that Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, think what it was that you there diſcovered, what inacceſſible Light, what cheriſhing Love, what daunting Majeſty, what infinite Purity, what over-loading Joy, what inſupportable and ſinking Glory, what Rays and Sparklings from Crowns and Scepters, but more from the Glances and Smiles of God upon the heavenly Hoſt, who forever warm and Sun themſelves in his Preſence: And when you have thought all this, then think once again that all your Thoughts are but Shadows and Glimmerings, that there is Duſt and Aſhes in the Eye of your Faith that makes all theſe Diſcoveries come infinitely ſhort of the Native Glory of theſe Things; and then you may gueſs, and gueſs ſomewhat near what Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

is. Nay as God, by reaſon of his infinite Glory, is better known to us by Negatives than by Affirmatives, by what he is not than by what he is; ſo is Heaven, by reaſon of the greatneſs of its Glory, better known to us by what it is not, than by what it is; and we may beſt conceive of it when it is told us: There is nothing there that may affright or afflict us, nothing that may grieve or trouble us, nothing that may moleſt or diſquiet us, but we ſhall have the higheſt and ſweeteſt Delight and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction that the vaſt and capacius Soul of Man can either receive or imagine. Are you now burthened with Sin and Corruption, thoſe Infirmities that tho' they are unavoidable, yet they make your Lives a Burthen to you?

Are you here op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed with Sorrows? Do Afflictions overwhelm you?

And wherefore is all this, but becauſe their Sight is ſhort and their Faith weak? They do not ſee afar off, nor believe a far off: Heaven they look upon as at a great diſtance, and very unwilling they are to go ſo long upon Truſt; and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual Perſons, as they are, they look for preſent Reward and preſent Wages, and will not ſtir till they have received it: And this is the <hi>Reaſon</hi> why the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of this great and infinite Glory affects Men no more, they look for ſomething preſent.</p>

And therefore that I may note it by the way, moſt Men are greatly miſtaken that labour and toil in the World to get Riches and great Eſtates, this is not the right thriving Courſe; if you would grow Rich, <hi>Firſt ſeek the kingdom of Heaven and the Righteouſneſs thereof; work out your own Salvation:</hi> Labour for the true Riches, and this will not only increaſe and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove

It was certainly a violent Pang of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempered Zeal in that Perſon, that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Fire in the one Hand and Water in the other; and being demanded a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of it, his Anſwer was, He would burn up Paradiſe and quench Hell-fire, that ſo God might be ſerved, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs embraced upon no other

What though the Way be long and tedious to the Fleſh? yet you are Travelling to your Father's Houſe, where you are ſure to be welcome, and where you ſhall enjoy an Eternity of Reſt and Repoſe, and ſhall ſit down with <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and the whole Ring of <hi>glorious Saints,</hi> diſcourſing to them of the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and Difficulties that you have paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed through in getting to them. Doth it not ſweeten the Toil and Pains that you take in your <hi>Youth,</hi> to think that thereby you are laying up that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon you may live at Eaſe hereafter, and ſpare the weakneſs of <hi>old Age?</hi> And is it not much more Rational that while you are in this World, which may be called the <hi>Youth of Eternity,</hi> you ſhould lay up a good Foundation and treaſure up a large, rich Stock, upon which you might live at Eaſe for <hi>ever?</hi> Why ſhould you not be as wiſe and politick for Heaven, as for a little of the periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Things of this World? Will you Labour that you may Reſt here, where
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:109965:83"/>
your Reſt ſhall certainly be diſquieted and you ſhook out of it; and will you not labour that you may Reſt in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, where alone you can enjoy an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Reſt? I know it is that invete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate prejudice that Men have taken up againſt the Ways of God, that they are painful and laborious, and this invali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates all Reaſons and Arguments that we bring them to perſuade them to work. Reſt, that is it they would have; and though God tells them they ſhall have an <hi>Eternal Reſt</hi> if they will but work a while; and tells them on the other Hand, <hi>that they ſhall never enter into Reſt,</hi> if they do not work, that they ſhall never enjoy more Eaſe than what they can find in <hi>Hell</hi> it ſelf, where their Groans and Bellowings, together with the Smoak of that bottomleſs Pit ſhall aſcend up for ever; yet ſuch is the madneſs of Mens <hi>Folly,</hi> that neither the <hi>Reſt</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> nor the <hi>Reſtleſsneſs</hi> of <hi>Hell,</hi> can ſtir or move them, but they roll themſelves up in their own Sloth and will hear nothing, nor lay any thing to Heart that may rouze or awaken them. Hath not God often called upon them by his Miniſters? <hi>Sinners, Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, awake,</hi> beſtir your ſelves, <hi>Hell-fire</hi>
                           <pb n="139" facs="tcp:109965:83"/>
is kindling about you, <hi>God</hi> is ready to open his Mouth to pronounce Sentence againſt you, <hi>Satan</hi> is ready to lay hold of you and to drag you to be tormented. One would think ſuch Execrations as theſe are, ſhould awaken the <hi>Carkaſſes</hi> that you ſet over, were they not in their final ſtate; and yet with you whoſe Souls are yet in their Bodies, but know not how ſoon they may be in <hi>Hell,</hi> who among you are moved with all that hath or can be ſaid of this Matter? nay, are you not like ſleepy Men when jogged, ready to grow pettiſh and to quarrel with us? Why do you moleſt us? Why do you envy us our Reſt? Why do you diſturb our Peace, and will not let us alone? Shall I ſay to you now, as once our Saviour ſaid to his Diſciples?<note place="margin">Luke 21.40.</note> 
                           <hi>Sleep on, and take your Reſt;</hi> ſleep on, and nod your ſelves into Deſtruction; ſleep on, and never wake more till the Flames of Hell awaken you. Truly we come not to diſturb your Reſt, but we come to inform and guide you to a better Reſt than what you can find here, even an eternal Reſt, a Reſt with him that is immortal, a Reſt with him who alone is unchangeable; and is not this Reſt worth a little Pains and Strugling to
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:109965:84"/>
obtain? Do you think you are always to believe and to repent, always to obey and mortifie your Corruptions? You cannot think ſo, unleſs you think you are always to live in this World: No, there is a Reſt remains for the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, after a few ſhort Days be gone. It is not therefore your Eaſe that you ſeek when you will not work; no, it is rather your Pain and eternal Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which ſhall certainly then be given unto all ſlothful Perſons; when the induſtrious and painful Chriſtian, that labours and works for Salvation, ſhall be admitted into the Eternal Reſt that he is aſpiring after, and hath already embraced in his Hope and Faith.</p>

                           <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Conſider, <hi>As in Heaven there is an eternal Reſt, ſo alſo in Heaven there is an eternal Work to be done:</hi> And therefore you ſhould inure your ſelves to that Work while you are here upon Earth. If Happineſs, according to the <hi>Philoſophers</hi> Notion, conſiſts in Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then in Heaven where there is the moſt perfect Happineſs, there muſt needs be the moſt perfect Operation. And therefore, whatever hath been
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:109965:84"/>
ſpoken of Reſt that remains, yet you are not ſo to conceive of it as poſſibly ſome groſs enough are apt to wiſh and fancy to themſelves, as if in Heaven the bleſſed were unactive and enjoyed there only a long Vacation, and only ſtretched themſelves on that Flowery Bank, and ſo void of Cares and Fears lull'd away an Eternity: No, theſe are too low and bruitiſh Apprehenſions for the Glory of that Place. That Reſt that is there to be expected and enjoyed is <hi>operative working Reſt;</hi> it is both Reſt and Exerciſe at once, and therefore it is a true <hi>Paradox;</hi> though the Saints in Heaven reſt from their Labours, yet they never reſt from their Working; continually are they bleſſing and praiſing of God, <hi>Aſcribing Glory, and Honour and Power to him that ſits upon the Throne, and to the Lamb for evermore:</hi> Always are they beholding, admiring and ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God, and burning in Love to each other, and mutually rejoycing in God and in one another: And this is the Work of that Eternal Reſt, a Work never to be intermitted nor to ceaſe. And therefore it is worth our obſerving, that both thoſe Places that do chiefly ſpeak of the future Reſt of the People of
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:109965:85"/>
God, do alſo intimate a Work in that Reſt. So the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> tells us,<note place="margin">Heb. 4.9.</note> 
                           <hi>There remains a Reſt for the People of God;</hi> the Word is, <hi>There remains a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath for the People of God.</hi> Look now you are to be imployed on a <hi>Sabbath,</hi> ſuch ſhall be your Imployment in your <hi>Eternal Reſt.</hi> Is it not your Work now upon a <hi>Sabbath-day</hi> to raiſe your Thoughts and Affections to Heaven, to fix and terminate them upon God, to maintain Communion with him, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire him in all his Works both of Grace and Providence, to ſtir up your own Hearts, and to quicken the Hearts of others to praiſe and adore him? Why this ſhall be the Work of your <hi>Eternal Sabbath.</hi> And when you are at any time lifted up to a more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Spiritualneſs in theſe Things, then may you give ſome gueſs what your Work ſhall be in Heaven, and what the frame of your Hearts ſhall be in your eternal Reſt. And ſo that other place in the <hi>Revelations, Bleſſed are the dead that die in the Lord, for they reſt from their labours, and their works follow them.</hi> Which may be meant not only of the Reward of their Works that they ſhall then receive, but of the Works
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:109965:85"/>
themſelves that here they performed on Earth; theſe ſhall follow them and enter into Heaven with them; and as they were done by them weakly and imperfectly here, ſo there the very ſame Works ſhall be done by them with abſolute and conſummate Perfection; all thoſe Works I mean that for the Matter and Subſtance of them do not connote a ſinful State and Condition. Now then, ſince you muſt be imploy'd in ſuch a Work as this is to Eternity, why do you not accuſtom your ſelves to it while you are here?<note place="margin">Col. 1.12.</note> The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> to the <hi>Coloſſians, Bleſſeth God who had made them meet to be made Partakers of the Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the Saints in Light.</hi> Were it a meet thing that thoſe that ſpend their whole time in Sin, ſhould be abruptly ſnatcht up into Heaven, to ſpend an Eternity there in Holineſs? And therefore God accuſtoms thoſe whom he ſaves in an ordinary way and manner, to work thoſe Works here on Earth that they are to be imployed in hereafter in Heaven; here they are <hi>Apprentices</hi> as it were that they may learn the <hi>Trade</hi> of Holineſs, that when that time comes they may become fit <hi>Citizens</hi> of the <hi>New Jeruſalem;</hi> here
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:109965:86"/>
God is trying their Eyes with more qualified and allayed Diſcoveries of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf that when they come to view him Face to Face, they may be able to bear the exceeding Brightneſs of his Glory. And therefore though you profeſs Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to be your Country, and <hi>that you are Strangers and Pilgrims here on Earth;</hi> yet ſay not with the Captive <hi>Jews,</hi>

Hence the Apoſtle exhorts us that we <hi>ſhould be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent, not ſlothful;</hi> and he grounds it upon this, <hi>becauſe in ſo doing, we ſhould be followers of them who through Faith and Patience inherit the Promiſes.</hi> In difficult and hazardous Enterprizes, every Man is apt to ſtand ſtill and ſee who will lead the way, and according to the Succeſs of the firſt Attempters, ſo either to be incouraged or diſmayed.

Why do you not ariſe and preſs upon the Footſteps of them who have gone before you, and ſhew'd you that the way is both certain and paſſable? Are you called to exerciſe <hi>Self-denial?

Are you aſſaulted with Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? St. <hi>Paul</hi> looks down and tells you that he had much ſtronger Temptations than you have, and yet he got ſafe to Heaven? Yea, our great Maſter and Pattern Jeſus Chriſt wrought out all Obedience; and what were the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives that put him upon this mighty Undertaking? It was not for his own Salvation and Happineſs, but it was for ours: Nay, the <hi>Scripture</hi> goes yet lower, it was,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.21.</note> 
                           <hi>To lead us an Example that we ſhould follow his Steps.</hi> Now ſhall Chriſt do all this, not for himſelf, but

for us, and ſhall we ſit ſtill and do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for our ſelves? Shall Chriſt take ſo much Pains to ſet us an Example, and ſhall not we follow that Example?

Methinks theſe Things ſhould add ſome Spurs to our Endeavours, and excite us to follow the Examples of thoſe that are gone before us, yea, and to leave an Example unto them that are to come after us; and though we do come after the Examples of others who are gone before us, yet the conſideration of their Examples who have gone through this Work, may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite us not to come behind them in any good Work.</p>

It is not a double La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour that is put upon you, firſt to find out your Duty, and then to perform it; no, the Light ſhines about you, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs you will ſeal up your Eyes againſt it, it is impoſſible but that it will ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time flaſh in upon you, and diſcover both what you have miſ-done, and what you ought to do. The <hi>Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi> have a <hi>Tradition</hi> among them, That <hi>Moſes Law</hi> and <hi>Chriſts Goſpel</hi> were written at firſt with Ink made of pure Light: This Conceit of theirs, though it be fond and ridiculous, yet it carries a myſtick Truth in it; the Scripture is as plain for matter of Duty, as if it had been written with a <hi>Sun-beam.</hi> Ordinances are diſpenſed freely and powerfully, ſo great a throng of Teachers and ſuch variety of Goſpel-Adminiſtrations, that Men muſt take almoſt as much Pains to keep themſelves ignorant of their Duty, as would ſuffice to perform their Duty. And wherefore think you is all this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Light given you? Is it not that
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:109965:90"/>
you might work by it? Doth a Maſter light up a Torch or Candle only that his Servants might play about it? And wherefore doth God light up the <hi>Sun</hi> of <hi>Truth</hi> in the <hi>Firmament</hi> of his <hi>Church?</hi> Is it only that you ſhould dally and trifle with it? No, it ſhines that you may work by it, and truly work by it you do; but alas! how many do work the Works of Darkneſs by the glorious Light of Truth? How many have Light enough to ſee that they are noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly wicked and prophane Swearers, Drunkards, Deſpiſers of Ordinances, Revilers at Religion and the Profeſſors of it, Enemies to what is ſober and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred in Chriſtianity? This Light they have flaſhing in their Faces from the clear Evidence of the word of God, and yet ſtill they continue to work the Works of Darkneſs. What ſhall I ſay to ſuch as theſe are? Truly I can ſay nothing worſe to them than what their own Conſciences already thunder againſt them, for they are ſelf-condemned Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. But truly this Complaint may too too juſtly be taken up againſt all that do not walk worthy of the Light vouchſafed to them; their Sins are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed clearly, and Duties are revealed
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:109965:90"/>
as clearly as the <hi>Scripture</hi> can poſſibly expreſs them, and yet they live in a groſs neglect of them. Well, believe it, this Light will not always ſhine to be gazed at only; the Day is drawing to an end, the Night is haſtning upon us, the darkneſs of the Night of Death, and the darker Night of Judgment; and oh! that then it may not be any of our Condemnations, <hi>That Light is come into the World, but we loved Darkneſs and the Works of Darkneſs better than Light, becauſe our Deeds were evil.</hi>

Now of all the Faculties in Man this was the leaſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by his Fall; though the Will be wholly corrupted and perverſe that it will not obey the Commands of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, yet Conſcience ſtill continues the performance of its Office, ſtill it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms, and urgeth, and threatens, and tormenteth; and thus may you ſee it
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:109965:92"/>
buſily working even in thoſe that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had the Law of God to direct Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. The <hi>Gentiles,</hi> ſays the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> to the <hi>Romans, that have not the Law,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Rom. 2.14, 15.</note>
                           <hi>do by Nature,</hi> that is, by natural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, <hi>the things contained in the Law, their Conſciences bearing witneſs, and their Thoughts, in the mean while, accuſing and excuſing one another.</hi> And becauſe they had not the Law, therefore Conſcience in them was like an Officer walking in the Dark, apprehending the Innocent and letting the Guilty eſcape: But yet this was from the beginning ſo deeply im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted in the Heart of Man, that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing muſt be done and avoided for to obtain Happineſs, which could never yet be obliterated. Tho' our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of what is Duty and what is Sin be in a great part defaced, yet this knowledg the <hi>Scripture</hi> doth abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſupply to us, and gives Conſcience a perfect Draught of all the Duties that God requires, and bids it be Overſeer and look that the Work be done. How? is it not a great Help when you have ſomewhat within you that ſtands for, and takes part with what is Good and what is your Duty? Conſcience ſecretly bids you beware of ſuch and
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:109965:93"/>
ſuch Sins that will bring Ruin, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and Vengeance upon you, and perform ſuch and ſuch Duties, Pray, Hear, Meditate, and be more fervent and affectionate in all your Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices; this is the way that tends to Life and Happineſs. Thus Conſcience daily and hourly is following of you, with Counſels and Chidings, and with Threatnings, denouncing Wrath and Vengeance againſt you; and though it ſpeaketh theſe Things with ſo low a Voice that others, though they lay their Ears to your Soul cannot hear it, yet in your Ears it ſpeaks as loud as Thunder, and no leſs terrible; it is in vain to wound it, it is in vain to ſtop its Mouth, for that will but make it break out with the more violence and out-rage; nothing can appeaſe it but Duty and Work. Why ſhould you not then, ſince you have that within you that ſtands for and prompts you to work, why ſhould you not as well fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low and obey the Dictates and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of your Conſciences that prompt you to Work and Duty, as obey the Propenſions of your ſenſual part to the contrary.</p>

                           <hi>God himſelf helps us by work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all our Works in us and for us; by working in us the will to work, and by work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for us the work when we have willed:</hi> And therefore while there is no part of our Work too hard for God, there ſhould be no part of it too hard and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult for us.

The frequent expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of every Child of God doth abundantly confirm this: Did you never begin a Duty with your Hearts liſtleſs and dead, with Affections cold and flat, with Thoughts very wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring and diſtracting, that at the very entrance of it you concluded you ſhould never make good Work of it, you ſhould never bring the Duty to a good Iſſue? And yet have you not in the midſt of theſe your Diſtempers found a mighty aſſiſtance and influence ſhining down from Heaven into your Hearts, filling them with holy and divine Affections, tranſporting them beyond all that dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that did oppreſs them, enlarging them with ſweet and heavenly Enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſo that no Duties were ended

And what is this but a ſenſible feeling of Gods working in you, that in the ſame performance you ſee your own weakneſs when you are left to your ſelves, and you ſee the Power of Gods Aſſiſtance when he comes in to help you, and there is no Duty but this divine Aſſiſtance may be hoped for and expected by you to enable you in the performance of it?

                           <hi>Conſider for your Incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it is not ſo much the abſolute and legal perfection of the Work, as the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Worker; that is, the perfection of the Heart that is looked at and rewarded by God:</hi> And is not this a great Incour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement? There is a twofold perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; the perfection of the Work, and the perfection of the Workman: The perfection of the Work is when the Work doth ſo exactly and ſtrictly anſwer the holy Law of God, that there is no irregularity in it. The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the Workman is nothing but
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:109965:95"/>
inward Sincerity, the uprightneſs of the Heart towards God, which may be where there are many Imperfections and Defects intermingled. If God ſhould accept and reward no Work but what is abſolutely perfect in reſpect of the Law, this would be ſuch a ſadning Diſcouragement that it would take off the Wheels of all Endeavours, for all our Obedience falls far ſhort of legal perfection in this Life. We our ſelves are conſcious of many failings and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections in our beſt Services, and God knows far more; and ſince we can do nothing without Infirmities, who would venture to do any thing upon the account of thoſe Infirmities, leſt God ſhould caſt back all again as Dung into our Faces? No, but we do not ſtand upon ſuch Terms as theſe are with our God, it is not ſo much what our Works are, as what our Heart is that God looks at and will reward: Yet know alſo, leſt any ſhould too ſoon lay hold on this; if our Hearts are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and ſincere, we ſhall endeavour to the utmoſt of our Power that our Works may be perfect according to the ſtrictneſs of the Law. I ſpeak not this therefore to incourage ignorant ſottiſh

Sinners, that though they live in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant courſe of Sin and neglect of Duty, yet ſooth up themſelves with this, God knows their Hearts are good, ſincere and upright. Let me cut off the fooliſh Hopes of theſe Men in a Word: It is impoſſible the Heart ſhould be ſincere where there is the allowance and liking of any one ſin in the Life. But I ſpeak what I have ſaid to thoſe who upon the ſight and ſenſe of their many Failings, of the deadneſs and untowardneſs of their Hearts, of their averſeneſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition, of their wandrings and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality in the performance of what is holy and good, upon the ſenſe of theſe things are ready to be dejected and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, and to give over doing of any thing, becauſe they can do nothing well: Let ſuch know, though their Works have not this legal Perfection, yet if they do proceed from a ſincere upright perfect Heart, they ſhall be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted and rewarded by God. <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah</hi> had his Failings, and the <hi>Prophet</hi> ſharply reproves him for his Pride, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> making a glorious and boaſting Oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of his Treaſure to the King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> yet he prays and appeals to God, <hi>Remember, O Lord, how I have

                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> When that End it doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh is not worth the Coſt and Pains. Now in neither of theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects is your Labour in vain. For,</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>First,</hi> It ſhall not fail to accompliſh the end to which it is ordained, and that is eternal Salvation. <hi>Three Things</hi> there are that make Men come ſhort in the accompliſhment of an End pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded.</p>

next below God and Chriſt, be it as high as <hi>Cherubims</hi> and <hi>Seraphims,</hi> I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay you think of an impoſſibility; your Labour may raiſe you to ſuch a pitch and advance you to ſuch Glory, as ſhall dazle the <hi>Sun</hi> in its brightneſs. It is true, there was once a time when Salvation might well be reckoned among thoſe Things that were impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible; and that was in that ſad interval between the <hi>Fall</hi> and the <hi>Promiſe</hi> of Chriſt, when all Mankind lay in the ſhadow and in the valley of Death; under the Breach and yet under the Bond of the Covenant of Works when it had indeed been in vain ſo much as once to have thought of Happineſs, or to have laboured for it: But ſince Chriſt's undertaking, <hi>We who were once without Hope, have now obtained good Hope through Grace; the Partition-Wall</hi> that then we could neither climb over nor break through, <hi>is now taken away;</hi> the Gate of Heaven is now ſet open, and with ſtriving we may enter, for our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt <hi>hath aboliſhed Death, and brought Life and Immortality to Light through the Goſpel.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though it may ſeem an impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to dejected and deſpairing Souls that
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:109965:98"/>
ever ſuch vile Wretches ſhould receive ſo great a Dignity, that thoſe who are ſunk ſo low in Miſery, ſhould ever be raiſed to Happineſs; that thoſe who are ſo loaden with Sin and Iniquity ſhould ever feel the weight of Mercy and beaten Glory; that thoſe whoſe beſt Works deſerve the loweſt <hi>Hell,</hi> ſhould, though not for, yet upon the performance of thoſe Works obtain the higheſt Heavens: Though this may ſeem to be an impoſſibility, yet believe it, while you think of any Glory lower than the Glory of the <hi>Godhead,</hi> you think of nothing above a poſſibility and the reach of Induſtry. There are none of you excluded from a poſſibility of being ſaved; the Covenant of Grace runs in moſt large and comprehenſive Terms, <hi>Who ever believeth ſhall obtain eternal Life.</hi> The Death of Chriſt and his Blood is a moſt ſovereign Medicine, applicable not only to all Maladies, but to all Men, if they will believe: Tho' it is true none ſhall be ſaved but the Elect, yet is it true alſo that a poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Salvation extends farther than Election. Election gives the infallibility of Salvation, as Reprobation doth the infallibility of Damnation; but yet as
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:109965:99"/>
there is a poſſibility for thoſe that ſhall infallibly be ſaved, to periſh if they do not believe; ſo is it poſſible for thoſe that ſhall infallibly periſh, to be ſaved if they will believe. The poſſibility of Salvation therefore ſtands not upon Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but upon two other Grounds.</p>
                        <p>

                           <hi>Firſt,</hi> The meritorious and all-ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient procurement of Chriſt, whereby he hath procured Salvation for all the World, and for all in the World, upon condition of their Faith, for that muſt ſtill be taken in; for were it not ſo, how could we preach Remiſſion of Sins in his Name to every Creature, were not his Death applicable to all? Then though ſome ſhould believe, yet for want of a Sacrifice offered up, and a Price paid down for them, they ſhould not be ſaved, though they ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. How then is it that we ſeriouſly call all Men to repent and believe, that their Sins may be pardon'd and their Souls ſaved? Certainly unleſs the death of Chriſt hath procured Salvation for all Men upon condition of Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, ſuch Calls would be falſe in us, and vain to them; for ſo we ſhould promiſe Salvation upon believing, to
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:109965:99"/>
thoſe to whom though they ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, Salvation ſhould be denied, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they want a Covenant made with them, and a Surety to undertake for them: Therefore, I ſay, Chriſt's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curement is general ſo far, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever believes ſhall receive the Benefit of his Death.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> As the Death of Chriſt is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> applicable to all for Salvation if they believe, ſo Faith that alone applies this Death is attainable by you all if you be not wanting to your ſelves; you are none of you under an impoſſibility of believing, and therefore not under an impoſſibility of Salvation. Though it be certain that ſome ſhall infallibly perſevere in Infidelity, yet there is none that hears the ſound of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and the outward Call of God in his Word, but may believe and obey if they be not wanting to themſelves: Neither is this Doctrin <hi>Arminianiſm,</hi> nor is it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to the efficacious Grace of God, whereby the Will is powerfully ſwayed to Faith and Obedience; for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting Grace of God is not given to make Men capable to believe and to be converted, but it is given to make them
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:109965:100"/>
actually believing and actually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting. The moſt wicked Man that is, without the converting Grace of God, is capable to be converted even in his ſtate of Unregeneracy, and convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Grace gives not any new Power to inable us to be converted, but it gives us an actual Converſion. Some ſhall never believe, and why? not becauſe they are under an impoſſibility, but becauſe they will not believe; it is not becauſe they cannot, but becauſe they will not, unleſs we would ſo gratifie their Sloth as to call their obſtinacy an impoſſibility: It is true they are obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and that obſtinacy can never be cured without efficacious Grace, but yet that obſtinacy is not properly called an impoſſibility.</p>
                        <p>Well, ſince Salvation is a thing poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, why do you not labour for it that your Souls may be eternally happy? Chriſt hath the <hi>Key of David, and he opens and none ſhuts;</hi> and he hath open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the everlaſting Gate to you all, and bids you all enter and take Poſſeſſion; there ſtand no grim Guards to keep out you, or you; you cannot complain that you are excluded by a forcible De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:109965:100"/>
no you ſhut the Doors upon your ſelves, and refuſe to enter. And this is the <hi>firſt Reaſon</hi> why Salvation is not La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in vain, becauſe the end is poſſible to be attained.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, <hi>There are alſo right means made known to you for the obtaining of this End. Jacob</hi> in his <hi>Dream</hi> ſaw a Ladder reaching from Earth to Heaven. Certainly there is a <hi>Jacob</hi>'s <hi>Ladder</hi> reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up from Earth to Heaven that is more than a <hi>Dream;</hi> every Round in it is either a Grace or a Duty; it is not hid from you what Grace you muſt act, what Duties you muſt perform, that you may obtain Happineſs; theſe are direct and proper means to it, nay, not only means to it, but the initials and beginnings of it. The glimering <hi>Light of Nature</hi> could diſcover that there was a future Happineſs, but it could not diſcover to us the right means thither, it could not direct us to believe in a cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified Saviour, and therefore to write by this dim <hi>Light of Nature</hi> had been Labour in vain: But now we know the way of Salvation is by Repentance towards God, and Faith towards our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; now we know that

Holineſs and Obedience do as certainly lead to Heaven, as Sin and Diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence drag down to Hell; and therefore while we continue believing and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is there any fear? Nay, is there any poſſibility of diſappointment in our great End? It is as impoſſible that Faith and Obedience ſhould not lead unto Glory, as it is that Faith ſhould, or Obedience not continue in Glory: And therefore, <hi>O Soul,</hi> be confident of ſucceſs. Haſt thou any good Evidences that thy Graces are genuine and true, though but weak; that thy Duties are ſincere, though but imperfect; and that thou doeſt work the Works of God with a ſteady Heart, though with a trembling Hand? Give this Aſſurance one lift higher, and as thou art already aſſured of the Truth of thy Grace, and of the Sincerity of thy Obedience, ſo henceforth be as much aſſured of thy fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Glory, as if it were no longer fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but now actually in thy preſent Poſſeſſion; thy dawning ſhall break forth into a moſt perfect Day; the Womb of thy Morning Twilight ſhall be delivered of a Noon-tide Brightneſs; thy Spark ſhall become a Sun; thy Seed of Grace ſhall ſprout till it be fit for

tranſplantation into Paradiſe, and there ſhall flower into Glory.</p>

<pb n="176" facs="tcp:109965:102"/>
Fear and Trembling, leſt the Wiles of Satan and the deceitfulneſs of your own Hearts, ſhould intice you from your Work, and cheat you of your Reward. <hi>Let us therefore fear</hi> (ſays the Apoſtle) <hi>leſt a Promiſe being made us of entring into his Rest, any of us ſhould fall ſhort.</hi> Yet as this may cauſe holy Fear, ſo it may be mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ſpiritual Joy and Rejoycing, that notwithſtanding the deadneſs of our Hearts, the ſlackneſs of our Hands, the many Avocations from without, the many Interruptions from within, yet none of us ſhall forſake our Work till we have brought it to Perfection; our Obedience ſhall be crowned with Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, and our Perſeverance with Glory and Immortality.

                           <note place="margin">Phil. 1.6.</note> 
                           <hi>that he that hath begun a good Work in you, will perform it till the day of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Let therefore the Mouth of <hi>Calumny</hi> be for ever ſtopt, that accuſeth this comfortable Doctrin of the Saints Perſeverance through Grace unto Glory, that accuſeth of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronizing Sloth and Idleneſs.

<pb n="177" facs="tcp:109965:102"/>
in evil Works, yet being Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians they need not fear that they ſhall fall ſhort of Glory. But though we do affirm that every true Chriſtian ſhall certainly inherit Heaven and Glory, yet we ſhake off this pernicious confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, for he is no true Chriſtian who is not zealous and careful of good Works, whoſe knowledge of his own Eſtate doth not provoke him <hi>to walk worthy of that Vocation wherewith he is called,</hi> whoſe hope of Heaven doth not inable him <hi>to purify himſelf, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Holineſs in the fear of God.</hi> What a contradiction is it to ſay, we patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize ſinful Sloth in Men, when we tell them if they are true Chriſtians that they ſhall continue working? Is it Sloth to continue working? Or do we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage Men to be idle, by aſſuring them if they are Chriſtians they muſt and ſhall work? Yet this is the natural ſtrain and tendency of our <hi>Doctrin.</hi> What greater Incouragement can you have to Obedience than this? If you will work you ſhall not fail of your End, becauſe the End it ſelf is poſſible, becauſe the Means to it are direct and certain, and becauſe if you once begin to work, you ſhall moſt aſſuredly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:109965:103"/>
till you have attained that End, even the Salvation of your own Souls. And this is one <hi>Reaſon</hi> why your La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour ſhall not be in vain.</p>

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, <hi>Your Labour ſhall not be in vain, becauſe this End ſhall fully anſwer, yea, infinitely exceed all that Coſt and Pains you are at in procuring it.</hi> It is not ſo in the Things of this World. As to this that of the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> holds true,<note place="margin">Pſal. 39.6.</note> 
                           <hi>Surely every Man walketh in a vain Shew, ſurely they are diſquieted in vain.</hi> Though they do attain their End, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that very End that they graſp is it ſelf but Vanity. But can any Man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count Heaven and Happineſs a vain Thing? Is it not infinitely worth all, yea, more than all that thou canſt do or ſuffer for it? Certainly when you come to enjoy it, you will not think it a hard Bargain that it ſtood you in ſo many Duties and Difficulties before you came to the poſſeſſion of it: No, if there could be any Sorrow in that ſtate of perfect Joy, it would be, not that we have done ſo much, but that we have done no more; not that we have gone through ſo much Anguiſh in Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, or that we have ſuſtained ſuch
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:109965:103"/>
great Conflicts in Self-denial and Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, but that we waded no deeper in our own Tears, and deeper in the Blood of our own Luſts; that we have not more vexed and croſſed our carnal ſelf, and taken more Pains in the ways of God; could there be any Sorrow in Heaven this would be the cauſe of it: But certainly a great part of our Joy there will be to reflect back upon thoſe Duties and Works of Obedience, through which, though with much ſtrugling and ſtriving, we have attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto that moſt bleſſed State. And this is the laſt Argument or Motive that I ſhall inſiſt upon; Work, for your Labour ſhall not be in vain, you ſhall certainly accompliſh your End, and this End ſhall abundantly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence you for all your Labour and Pains.</p>
                        <p>Well then to conclude this Head, you have at large ſeen what can be pleaded on the behalf of Obedience; What is it now that you can <hi>Object</hi> againſt theſe Things? Are they not true? Are they not cogent? Your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences I know tell you that they are ſo; why then do they not prevail with
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:109965:104"/>
you? Why ſit you ſtill holding your Arms in your Boſoms? Sirs, I have not ſpoken to you <hi>Fables</hi> or <hi>Myſteries</hi> that cannot be underſtood, but the Truth in all plaineſs; and if you will not lay it to Heart, believe it there is a Day a coming, when you ſhall too late know that once you had a proffer of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and you might have been happy for working for it: But, alas! this is the deſperate Folly of Men, they do not prize Salvation while it is attainable, they never account their Souls precious till they are loſt, yea, and loſt beyond all hope of recovery. I cannot tell how theſe many and weighty <hi>Arguments</hi> that have been propounded may work with you, God and your own Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences know; but this I can tell, the <hi>Devil</hi> can never bring ſuch ſtrong <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> why you ſhould deſtroy and damn your ſelves, as have now been laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you why you ſhould work out your own Salvation: And if they do not prevail with you, truly there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that you can plead for your ſelves: You cannot plead that you could not do theſe Things, that Objection hath been anſwered; you cannot plead that there would no Profit ariſe to you
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:109965:104"/>
if you did them, for the <hi>Reward</hi> hath been abundantly diſcovered to you; if you plead any thing it muſt be becauſe you will not do them, and that is the thing that will condemn you: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if theſe Things do not prevail with you, if you ſtill continue obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and inſtead of working the Works of God, you work the Works of your Father the <hi>Devil;</hi> God acquits him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, your Blood lies not upon him, you have been fairly warned and told of it, but your own Deſtruction ſhall juſtly lie upon your own Heads.</p>
                        <p>And thus having done with the <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> to preſs you to this Duty of working out your own Salvation with Fear and Trembling; I come now to Anſwer ſome <hi>Objections.</hi> And,</p>

Many Mens Conſciences indeed are like <hi>Iron</hi> that hath lain for ſome time out of the Fire, that you would not ſuſpect to be hot till you let ſome Water fall upon it, and then it appears to be ſo by its noiſe and hiſſing: So truly their Conſciences ſeem cold and dead and ſuch as you might handle at your pleaſure; but when once God lets fall ſome Drops of

his Wrath upon their Conſciences, then they hiſs and boil, and fill the Soul with Smoak and Smother. A hard Heart is no ſecurity from a troubled Conſcience. It is with the Hearts and Conſciences of wicked Men, as it is with a Sore in the Body, which it may be is the hardeſt part in the Body and yet the ſoreſt alſo, the red Fleſh about the Sore is hard and yet full of Pain and Anguiſh: So is it many times with the Hearts and Conſciences of wicked Men, which though they are exceeding hard, yet are full of Pain and Anguiſh.

<pb n="185" facs="tcp:109965:106"/>
it; nay, let every Sinner ſpeak, How is it with you after the madneſs and rage of your Sin is over? Are you not then haunted with direful Thoughts of Horror and Amazement, that are as it were gnawing and devouring your Hearts? And are theſe they who are content to buy Eaſe and Quietneſs at ſo dear a rate, as the loſs of their precious and immortal Souls, and to be eternally tormented hereafter, beſides their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Pain and Anguiſh after the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting of Sin now, which if they feel not always yet frequently they do? But if God ſhould give them up to ſuch hardneſs of Heart as to become altogether inſenſible and ſtupid while they continue in this World, yet what will this avail them? Will they not purchaſe their Eaſe and Pleaſure very dearly, to loſe their Souls for ever here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, and to ſuffer the Pains of Hell eternally? The <hi>Devil</hi> hath put a horrid Cheat upon theſe Men; for they do not change their Troubles and Sorrows, but only the time of them, and for a little fanſied ſenſual Eaſe and Pleaſure in this World, which it may be they may enjoy and it may be not; for poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly God may be ſo provoked by them,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:109965:107"/>
that he may ſuddenly cut them off in their Sins; but if not, it is but for a very little time that the Pleaſures of their Sins and Luſts will laſt, and then an Eternity of Pain and Torment ſhall be their Portion. Sinners, be not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deceived; ſuffer not the <hi>Devil</hi> to abuſe you, and to impoſe his Drudgery upon you, under the pretence of Eaſe and Quietneſs: If therefore it be only preſent Contentment and Satisfaction that you ſeek, if you think that you ſhall periſh, but yet you would periſh the eaſieſt way; that is not, believe it, that is not by giving up of your ſelves to a way and courſe of Sin, but in a way of Duty and laborious Working; in that only can you find preſent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, and in that poſſibly you may find eternal Happineſs.</p>

it is much, yea, very much that you may do in order to your Salvation.</p>

No wiſe Man will try to mount up the
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:109965:113"/>
higheſt Round of a Ladder at the firſt ſtep. But yet many ſuch prepoſterous Endeavours there are found among Men in the working out of their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. In reſpect of Doctrinals St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, ſome built <hi>Hay</hi> and <hi>Stubble</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a <hi>Foundation</hi> of <hi>Gold,</hi> 1 Cor. 8. But in reſpect of Practicals, it is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent that many Men endeavour to build <hi>Gold</hi> upon a <hi>Foundation</hi> of <hi>Hay</hi> and <hi>Stubble:</hi> Theſe Mens Buildings will ſoon totter, fall and come to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Ruin, Shame and Diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment. Now the right diſpoſing of your great Work lies thus. <hi>Firſt,</hi> You are to work from Nature for Grace, and then from Grace unto the holy and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual performance of Duty, by which Grace is much confirmed and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; and ſo continuing in Duty to arrive at Aſſurance; and from this the next ſtep is Salvation. From Nature to Grace, and from Grace to Duty. See this Method laid down by the <hi>Apoſtle, Let us,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Heb. 12.28.</note> ſays he, <hi>have Grace whereby we may ſerve God acceptably, with Reverence and godly fear.</hi> This is the <hi>Ladder</hi> of Heaven, whoſe bottom Step is below Grace in Nature, and whoſe utmoſt Step is above it in abſolute Perfection
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:109965:113"/>
and Glory. <hi>Firſt,</hi> there muſt be Grace before any Duty can be performed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptably unto God. But now moſt Men pervert and diſturb this Method; and the ordinary way of Diſturbance is this, they are frequent in Duties, but they perform them not either for Grace, or from Grace; neither that they may attain Grace by them, nor that they may exerciſe Grace in them: And yet, notwithſtanding, theſe Men think and hope to work out Salvation by ſuch Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties as theſe are, making a Leap from Duties to Salvation, neglecting to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that Grace that can make their Duties acceptable and ſaving; and hence it is that they make no quicker diſpatch and riddance in their great Work. Now ſuch Attempts as theſe are,</p>
                        <p>Firſt, <hi>Diſcouraging and diſheartning.</hi>

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Duties never flow freely from the Soul where Grace is not like a continual Fountain to ſupply it. <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaking of

the <hi>Hypocrite,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Job 27.10.</note> asks this Queſtion, <hi>Will he delight himſelf in God? will he always call upon him?</hi> No, he will not. It is not poſſible that he ſhould do ſo, tho' for a time he may drive at a high rate, praying both with Fervency and Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, yet will he ſoon decay and faint, becauſe he hath no Life of Grace to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry him through Duties; but he finds them to flow ſtubbornly from him, and therefore through Wearineſs and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content at laſt he gives them over. The good Works of graceleſs Perſons may be as flouriſhing as if indeed they were true Saints; but they have not a Root to ſupply them, <hi>the Root of the Matter,</hi> as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>is not in them,</hi> and therefore they are ſoon nipt and fade away. It is ſimply impoſſible that a Perſon, without the Life and Power of Grace, ſhould perſevere in a cordial, affectionate performance of good Works; Intereſt, Credit, Reſpect and natural Conſcience, are too weak Wheels for ſo great a Burthen; it is Grace only that can over-ballance all outward Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements, yea, and which is more that alone can remove all inward alſo: This can make Obedience ſweet to a Child of God, which to a wicked Man

                           <hi>Created,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>to good Works.</hi> Good Works are no otherwiſe neceſſary to Salvation, but as they are the exerciſes of Grace, by which we expreſs the life and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, ſo only are they neceſſary unto Salvation. How ſhould Grace be ſeen and known but by Works? <hi>Firſt,</hi> God imprinted his own Image upon
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:109965:115"/>
our Souls in Regeneration, and ſtamps us Feature for Feature, Grace for Grace, and Glory for Glory: But now becauſe this is hid and concealed, therefore are we to copy forth this Image in a holy Converſation, and to expreſs every Grace in ſome Duty or Work of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience or other. As thoſe that we call <hi>falling Stars</hi> dart from Heaven and draw after them long Trains of Light, ſo God would have us to ſhoot up to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but yet to leave a Train of Light behind us; our Graces muſt ſhine al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, we muſt go on in good Works, and theſe good Works are of no value or account with God, of which Grace is not the End or Principle. What ſays the Apoſtle?<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.3.</note> 
                           <hi>Though I beſtow all my Goods to feed the Poor and have not Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, it profiteth me nothing.</hi> Can a Man beſtow all his Goods upon the Poor, and not be charitable? Indeed the Word that we tranſlate <hi>Charity,</hi> might, for the avoiding of ſome Miſtakes, better have been tranſlated <hi>Love;</hi> but, however, we muſt take <hi>Charity</hi> for a diſpoſition to relieve the Wants and Neceſſities of others with reſpect of <hi>Love</hi> to God and his Image; if this good Work be not from Grace through a
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:109965:116"/>
Principle of <hi>Love</hi> to God and Obedience to his Command, it is but the empty Shell and Husk of a good Work, and it avails a Man nothing. Yea further, if after this, <hi>I give my Body to be burned and have not Charity, it profiteth me no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing:</hi> If my <hi>Soul</hi> burn not as clear and bright in <hi>Love,</hi> as my <hi>Body</hi> in the Flames, it availeth me nothing, I burn only what was dead before, and offer a Carkaſs inſtead of a Sacrifice. There is no Work or Duty, how ſpecious ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, that is of any profit to the Soul, if that Work or Duty hath not the Life and Power of ſome Grace or other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in it. Well then, this is the <hi>firſt</hi> Ground why Works without Grace are fruitleſs, becauſe they are empty and liveleſs. Grace is the Life and Spirit of good Works.</p>

                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> All Attainments and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, all Endeavours and Duties, without Grace, can never mortifie and ſubdue the Power and Dominion of any one Luſt or Corruption. Men may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert and chain, and reſtrain their Corruptions, and impale in their Luſts, ſo that they ſhall not break forth into any outragious Wickedneſs; but yet without Grace they can never ſubdue them, becauſe it is Grace alone that can lay the Ax to the Root of this evil Tree. Well then, notwithſtanding all that hath been ſaid concerning the Power of Nature, what Men may do thereby and how far they may go, yet here you ſee what Impotency there is in Nature without Grace, and what it cannot reach to perform. But now this is not ſpoken that hereby any ſhould be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged from Working, and becauſe ſome doubt of the Truth of their Graces, that therefore they ſhould deſiſt from a courſe of Holineſs and Obedience; this were plainly to thwart the whole de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of this Subject: No, all that hath been ſaid, is, to perſuade Men not to reſt ſatisfied in any Work of Obedience or Religion, in which ſome Grace is
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:109965:117"/>
not breathed or exerciſed, nor to look upon them at all as inductive to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as in themſelves, but as in reference to true Grace. How many poor Souls are there, who becauſe they run on in a round of Duties, becauſe they do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that they call good Works, think that Salvation is as ſure their own, as if all the Promiſes in the Scripture were ſealed and delivered to them by God himſelf? And yet poor Creatures, never examine or regard from what Principle this their Obedience flows, whether from a Principle of Grace, or from the old corrupt Principle of Nature, new-vampt from ſome new Operations of the common Spirit: Believe it, this is not that Obedience that God requires, nor that he will accept; an inward <hi>Groan,</hi> if breathed by Grace, is of more account with God, and will be more available to the Soul than the moſt pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous and ſpecious Services of unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Men. What is it to God, when you offer not only the Blind and the Lame, but the Dead alſo? Is it not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an Abomination than Obedience? The Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Without Works,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Jam. 3.20.</note> 
                           <hi>Faith is dead.</hi> And it is as true on the other ſide alſo, that Works without
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:109965:118"/>
Faith and other Graces of the Spirit, are not only dead, but rotten and noiſome. Every Duty Men perform in a graceleſs State and Condition God muſt needs loath it and them for it; <hi>The Prayer of the Wicked is an Abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto the Lord.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Prov. 28.9.</note> It is as hateful unto God, as Vapors that aſcend up out of <hi>Tombs,</hi> from putrified Bodies, are unto us. What then? muſt ſuch Perſons give up themſelves to Sin therefore? God forbid. No, rather let ſuch think thus; if our Duties and our Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs be ſo loathſome, what are our Sins and Iniquities? Though every Sinner be <hi>dead in Sins and Treſpaſſes,</hi> yet is it leſs offenſive to have a dead Carkaſs em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balmed than to have it lie open. Still therefore continue working, but in your working, <hi>Firſt,</hi> aim at the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of Grace, before you aim at the obtaining of Heaven and Salvation; let it at no time content you that ſuch and ſuch Duties you have performed, but look what Grace have you acted in them; what is there of God breathing in this Prayer that I now put up? How am I in Hearing, in Meditation, in Diſcourſing of the Things of God? Is my Heart holy and ſpiritual? Are my
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:109965:118"/>
Affections pure and fervent? Are my Graces active and vigorous? And are they vigorous in this Work of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? Elſe to perform Duties, and to neglect Grace that alone can inable us to perform Duties acceptably, is only to go to <hi>Hell</hi> a little more cleanly.</p>
                        <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Direct. 2.</note> 
                           <hi>If you would work out your own Salvation, as you must look to the actings of Grace, as well as to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of Duties, ſo you muſt labour to grow and increaſe in thoſe Graces that are moſt active and working; and they are Two, the Grace of Faith, and the Grace of Love.</hi> To grow ſtrong in theſe Graces is the moſt compendious way for a Chriſtian to diſpatch his great Work; I may call them the two Hands of a Chriſtian; and he that is moſt active in theſe, works out his Salvation with both Hands earneſtly.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, <hi>The actings of Faith is of mighty <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> advantage to the working out of our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Two Senſes</hi> there are in which Salvation may be ſaid to be wrought out. <hi>Firſt,</hi> In Title: And, <hi>Secondly,</hi> In actual Poſſeſſion and Enjoyment. Now Faith is a working out of the one,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:109965:119"/>
and a compendious furtherance towards the working out of the other.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
                           <hi>Firſt,</hi> Upon our believing Salvation is already wrought out for us in Right and Title. <hi>He that believeth ſhall be ſaved;</hi> here is the Title. The great Work is then done and finiſhed, when once Faith is wrought: And therefore, when the <hi>Jews</hi> came to enquire of our Saviour,<note place="margin">John 6.24, 29.</note> 
                           <hi>How they ſhould do to work the Works of God?</hi> Our Lord tells them, <hi>This is the Work of God, that you believe on him whom he hath ſent.</hi> Nay further, as a Faith of Adherence or Acceptance gives a Right and Title to Salvation, ſo a Faith of full Aſſurance is this Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation it ſelf:<note place="margin">Heb. 11.1.</note> For, <hi>Faith is the ſubſtance of Things hoped for, the Evidence of Things not ſeen:</hi> In its juſtifying Act it gives a Title to Salvation, in its aſſuring Act it gives the ſubſtance of the Thing it ſelf; for it is much at one to a ſtrong Faith to believe Heaven, and to enjoy it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> Faith doth compendiouſly further and promote the working out of our Salvation in actual poſſeſſion; and that becauſe Faith is that Grace which
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:109965:119"/>
fetcheth all that ability and ſtrength from Chriſt, whereby a Chriſtian is inabled to work: Faith is not only a Grace of it ſelf, but it is Steward and Purveyor for all other Graces, and its Office is to bring in Proviſion for them while they are working; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as a Mans Faith grows either ſtronger or weaker, ſo his Work goes on more or leſs vigorouſly. When other Graces are in want, and cry Give, Give, then Faith betakes it ſelf to Chriſt, and ſaith, <hi>Lord,</hi> ſuch a Grace ſtands in need of ſo much Strength to ſupport it, and ſuch a Grace ſtands in need of ſo much Support to act it, and I have nothing to give it my ſelf, and therefore I come to fetch Supplies from thee: And certainly this Faith that comes thus empty-handed unto Chriſt, never goes away empty-handed from Chriſt. What is it that you complain of? Is it that the Work ſtands at a ſtay, and you cannot make it go forward? Is it that Temptations are ſtrong and violent, that Duties are hard, irkſome and difficult? Why ſet Faith on work to go to Chriſt, and there you may be ſure to have Supply, becauſe Faith is an omnipotent Grace; <hi>All things are poſſible
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:109965:120"/>
to him that believeth,</hi> and that becauſe all things are poſſible to that God, and to that Chriſt, on whom Faith is acted. There is no Grace, nor no Supply, nor Mercy laid up in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, but it is all in the Hands of a Believer's Faith, and he may take from thence whatſoever he needs to ſupply the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Wants and Neceſſities of his Soul.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, <hi>Another working Grace is the fervent actings of Love.</hi> Love is the great Wheel of the Soul that ſets all the reſt a moving, and makes it like the <hi>Chariots of Aminadab,</hi> to run ſwiftly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards its deſired <hi>Object.</hi> There is a mutual dependence between Faith and Love in their working; Love depends upon Faith to ſtrengthen it, and Faith depends again upon Love to act it. As we love not that which we do not know, and our knowledge of God and of the Things of Eternity is by Faith, not by Viſion, ſo thoſe Things which we do know and which we do believe, yet if we love them not we ſhall never endeavour after them: The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> therefore tells us, that <hi>Faith worketh by Love.</hi> Now there is a threefold ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:109965:120"/>
Love required to expedite our great Work.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, <hi>A tranſcendent Love of God.</hi>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
                        </p>
                        <p>Secondly, <hi>A regular Love of our ſelves.</hi>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thirdly, <hi>A complacential Love unto <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and Delight in our Work it ſelf.</hi> Now when the Affections go out after theſe <hi>Objects</hi> of Love, this will much facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate our great Work.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, <hi>The Love of God is a great help <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> to our Duty.</hi> Our Saviour therefore ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth Obedience upon this very account; <hi>If ye love me, keep my Commandments.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">John 14.15. 1 John 5.3.</note>
                           <hi>And,</hi> ſays the <hi>Apoſtle, this is the Love of God,</hi> that is, this is a certain Sign, or it is the conſtant effect of our Love to God, <hi>that we keep his Commandments, and his Commandments are not grievous;</hi> they are not grievous becauſe they are his Commandments who is the Love and Joy of our Souls. Divine Love always conforms it ſelf to divine Precepts, and that for two Reaſons:</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe this Grace, as it deſires <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the beatifical Union to God in Glory
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:109965:121"/>
hereafter, for Love is the deſire of Union; ſo now it cauſes an unſpeakable Union of Will, and a ſupernatural ſimpathy of Affection betwixt God and the Soul; which Union cannot be a Union of Equality or Entity as is in the Perſons of the bleſſed Trinity, and therefore it is a Union of Subordination of a Chriſtians Will to the Will of God. Now what is this Will of God? Why the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> tells us;<note place="margin">1 Theſ. 4.3.</note> 
                           <hi>This is the Will of God,</hi> ſays he, <hi>even your Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</hi> And the ſame <hi>Apoſtle</hi> tells us, in another place,<note place="margin">Eph. 2.10.</note> 
                           <hi>We are his Workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip created in Chriſt Jeſus unto good Works, that God hath before ordained that we ſhould walk in them.</hi> And is this Gods Will, and ſhall it not be our Work? Hath God ordained that we ſhould walk therein, and ſhall we be averſe from or ſlothful thereunto? How can we pretend we love God, while we neglect the only Thing he requires from us, Holineſs and Obedience? God wills our Holineſs, becauſe there is no better a thing that he can Will next unto himſelf; the Image of God, next to himſelf, is the moſt excellent and chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Good; every thing, the nearer it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proacheth unto God, the more deſirable
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:109965:121"/>
it becomes in it ſelf: Now that which comes moſt near unto God, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanceth the Soul in ſome reſemblance and ſimilitude to him, is Holineſs and Endeavours after Obedience, whereby we become conformable unto God, and attain ſome faint Shadows and Eſſays of the divine Perfections: The Soul wills in order unto Gods Will; God now wills Holineſs becauſe it is moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable, and we muſt will our own Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, becauſe if we love God as we pretend to do, our Wills muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to his holy Will.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> Love to God is a Help to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Duty, becauſe it is in and by Duty that we enjoy the Preſence of God, and have Communion and Fellowſhip with him. Theſe are the Lattices through which God appears to the longing Soul; and though he many times vouchſafes but half Smiles and little Glances, yet in theſe reſerved Communications the Soul finds ſo much ſweetneſs, as ingageth it to a conſtant performance of Duties all its Days: Here, <hi>ſays the Soul,</hi> God was wont to walk in his Sanctuary, here have I heard his Voice, here have I ſeen his Face, his
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:109965:122"/>
Spirit hath here breathed upon me, his Conſolations have here refreſhed me, and therefore here will I wait upon him as long as I live. I remember well, <hi>ſays the Soul,</hi> when in Prayer and Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation my Heart hath been filled by him, poured out to him, and accepted with him: I remember when he filled me firſt with Sighs, and then with Songs, and both alike unutterable, and therefore I will keep to the performance of theſe Duties, waiting for the further Diſcoveries and Manifeſtations of my God unto me.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, <hi>As Love to God, ſo a regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Self-love will much help and further our Obedience and Duty.</hi> And then is Self-love truly regular, when Men love their own Souls as God loves them. Now Gods love to the Souls of Men is ſuch, that though <hi>He wills all Men to be ſaved,</hi> yet he wills that none ſhall be ſaved, <hi>but through ſanctification of the Spirit and belief of the Truth.</hi> And whilſt we love our ſelves, if we obſerve the ſame method and order, this Self-love is always commendable and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. Deſires after eternal Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Salvation are natural to that
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:109965:122"/>
Soul that is truly conſcious of its own Immortality, and eternal, unalterable State and Condition; and when theſe Deſires are directed to future Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs through preſent Holineſs, then are they regular and become gracious. We are not ſo ſtraitly limited by Gods Sovereignty over us, but while we fix one Eye upon our Work, we may fix the other on our Reward: God is not ſo ſtrict in his Prerogative over us, as to require Service from us from what we have already received from him: He is not as a cruel Lord and Maſter to ſay, Obey me, though afterwards you periſh; ſee to it that you love and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie me, though I eternally puniſh you; though conſidering that infinite diſtance we ſtand at from God, we could object nothing againſt the Equity of his Proceedings: No, but God hath ſo graciouſly twiſted his Glory and our Duty together, that while we promote the one we do alſo promote the other, and while we work for God we do but work for our ſelves. Now are there any that need to be perſuaded to love themſelves? Is it not the great and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Sin that all Men love and ſeek themſelves? And do not Men by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:109965:123"/>
Self-lovers, become Self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyers? Yes, they do ſo; but it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſeek themſelves out of Gods way, that therefore they loſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, for ever. <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Holineſs</hi> are not ſuch ſevere things, as to exclude Self-love; nay, right Self-love is that which is no where to be found ſeparate from true Grace. Miniſters call upon Men to exerciſe Self-denial and Self-ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence; and this the fooliſh World miſtakes as if ſo be they exhorted them to divorce themſelves from themſelves, to lay aſide all reſpect and conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Self, and to offer violence to the moſt common Principles of Self-pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation. No, would to God we all ſought our ſelves more earneſtly and conſtantly than we do, and that we all knew wherein our greateſt Intereſt and Concernment did lie; then ſhould we not leave our great Work undone, nor gratifie the Sloth of our corrupt Humors, and the ſinful propenſions of our carnal part, nor ſhould we think what we do for Sin and Satan we do for our ſelves; no, all this is to hate our ſelves: And wicked Men at the laſt Day ſhall know, they have been their own moſt bitter and moſt impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:109965:123"/>
Enemies, that they would not be content with any thing leſs than their own eternal Ruin. A true Chriſtian is the only ſelfiſh Man in the World; all others, they are not Self-lovers but Self-deſtroyers: What ſhall I ſay more than this? The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> asks, <hi>Did ever any Man hate his own Fleſh?</hi> Did ever any Man delight to gaſh and burn, to wrack and torture himſelf? Truly I may ask the quite contrary. Do almoſt any love their own Spirits, their ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual part, their Souls? This they wound and gaſh by many a bloody Sin, this they burn and fear by hardneſs and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitency, this they go about to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and torment in <hi>Hell</hi> for ever. Oh therefore be perſuaded at length to take pity on your ſelves, conſidering you are but deſtroying while you think you are embracing of your ſelves; and that will be found but Self-murder at laſt, which you now call Self-love.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, <hi>A complacential Love to,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">3. Love to our Work makes it eaſie.</note> 
                           <hi>and Delight in your Work, is a great further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of it.</hi> A wicked Man ſerves God grudgingly, he murmurs at Duties, and looks upon them only as Tasks and Burthens, thinking every thing he
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:109965:124"/>
doth for God too much, too heavy and weighty. The Commands of God are all of them hard Sayings and grievous Impoſitions that he cannot bear; he could believe Chriſt ſooner in any thing than when he tells him,<note place="margin">Mat. 11.28.</note> 
                           <hi>My Yoke is eaſy and my Burthen is light.</hi> Here he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not believe Chriſt. Thus much time, ſaith the <hi>ſlothful Sinner,</hi> muſt I ſpend in Prayer, and there muſt I humble my ſelf to God whom I hate, and confeſs before him thoſe Sins that I love, and beg that Grace that I have ſlighted; ſo much time muſt I ſpend in reading the Law that I never mean to obſerve, peruſing over only the Sentence of my Condemnation; and ſo often muſt I fix and dwell upon holy and ſpiritual Thoughts, which never at any time darted into, or paſſed intranſiently, but they did diſcompoſe me, and leave me a damp and ſadneſs upon my Spirit behind them; and therefore becauſe there is not a holy complacency and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the Service of God, all ſuch Mens Endeavours are both faint, incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and languiſh while they are about them, and ſeldom do they re-aſſume them again. But a true Chriſtian works with abundance of Delight and
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:109965:124"/>
Chearfulneſs in the Service of God, in every Duty his Soul is filled full of holy Affections, by which it ſoars up to Heaven: Duties are Meat and Drink to him, ſpiritual <hi>Manna,</hi> in which he takes more ſatisfaction and contentment than wicked Men do in their Sins, and therefore he performs theſe Duties ſo earneſtly, becauſe he doth it with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency: All that he repines at, is, that natural Neceſſity, ſinful Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Infirmities and worldly Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, that do purloin ſo much of his time from this great Work. Now when once the Heart is brought to ſuch a frame and temper as this, thus to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in Obedience and in the Work and Service of God, then will this working for Salvation go on with Power.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. Working for Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt be with Fear and Tremb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</note> 
                           <hi>Another Direction is that in the Text, Work for Salvation with Fear and Trembling.</hi> A trembling Hand beſt performs a Chriſtians Work. Now this Fear is not a Fear of diſtruſt or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondency, for that is ſo contrary to this Duty of working for Salvation, as that it ſtupifies and benums all Endeavours, and is a great Enemy to the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of this Duty. But,</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="220" facs="tcp:109965:125"/>

                           <hi>Firſt,</hi> It is a Fear of Solicitude and Carefulneſs as it ſtands oppoſed to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſecurity, and that preſumption that is the common and ordinary Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of moſt Men. This holy Fear is the beſt preſervative of true Grace: The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> therefore tells us, <hi>Thou ſtandeſt by Faith;</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Rom. 11.20.</note> 
                           <hi>be not high-minded but fear;</hi> implying, they would not ſtand long though they ſtood by Faith, unleſs they were upheld with godly Fear: And the Reaſon is, becauſe it is the property of Fear to foreſee and forecaſt Dangers, and to put the Soul in a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of defence and ſecurity before they approach: For as the <hi>wiſe Man</hi> tells us, <hi>The prudent Man foreſeeth the Evil and hideth himſelf,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Prov. 20.3</note> 
                           <hi>but the Simple paſs on and are puniſhed.</hi> They are raſh and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in their Undertakings, and ſo they paſs on and are puniſhed. Fear makes a Chriſtian circumſpect and conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive with himſelf, how he may keep from Miſcarriages in the performance of his great Work. If God call me to ſuch a Duty, how ſhall I perform it? If to bear ſuch a Croſs and Affliction, how ſhall I glorifie him under it? If to conflict with ſuch Temptations, how
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:109965:125"/>
ſhall I reſiſt and overcome them? Yea, how ſhall I do to break through all Difficulties, Duties and Oppoſitions that I who am but a weak and feeble Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian may meet withal, and how ſhall I do to bear up? And thus pondring what may be his Duty, and forecaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what Duties God may call him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, he is inabled to do what is his Duty at preſent, and what alſo may by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence hereafter become his Duty: Nothing overtakes ſuch a Man unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, nor doth any thing ſurprize him unprovided for it. And thus a careful Fear enables him in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of his great Work.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> A Fear of Humility and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> holy Reverence of God, induceth much to the working out of our Salvation, and that in three Particulars.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Firſt,</hi> It much helps us in our great <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Work to fear God as our Lord and Maſter that ſees and overlooks all our Works, obſerving both what we do, and how we do it alſo. That Servant muſt be deſperately bold that will dare to be idle, or ſlight and perfunctory in his Work, while his Maſters Eye is
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:109965:126"/>
upon him. Why Chriſtians ſhould conſider Gods Eye is always upon them, in Praying, in Hearing, and in every Duty that they perform, yea, in every Action of their whole Lives: And if the Eye of a Maſter, that is but a Fellow Creature, nay, but a Fellow Servant, can have ſuch awe and influence upon his Servant as to make him careful how he works and what he works, and to make him diligent in his Work: Should not much more the conſideration of Gods Eye being upon us, who ſtands at an infinitee diſtance from us, cauſe a holy Fear and Diligence in us, in doing what our Lord and Maſter commands us?</p>
                        <p>

                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> Fear God alſo as him from whom you have all your Power and Ability to work; Fear him, leſt at any time through any neglect or miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage of yours, he ſhould be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked to ſuſpend his Influence and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw his Grace from you, and to leave you to your own Weakneſs and Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency, upon whoſe influence all your Obedience doth depend. This is the <hi>Apoſtles Argument</hi> in the Text, <hi>Work with Fear, for God works in you both to
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:109965:126"/>
Will and to Do.</hi> Holy diligence in Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience cannot be more ſtrongly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced on an ingenious Spirit, than by conſidering all that Strength and Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity that we have to work, is received from God, and therefore ſhould be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved for God, leſt, for our Sloth, he deprives us of that we make no uſe of.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Thirdly,</hi> In working, fear God alſo,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> as he that will be the Judge and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warder of your Works for ever. You perform them unto him who is to paſs Sentence upon them, and upon you for them; and will you then dare to do them ſlothfully and negligently? God will try every Mans Work with Fire, and will call every Action to a ſevere and ſtrict account; every Mans Work ſhall be ſeen through and through, and then it ſhall be known who hath wrought the Works of God, and who hath fulfilled the Will of Satan; and the final Doom and irreverſible Sentence ſhall then be pronounced according to Mens Works. <hi>God will,</hi>

Chriſt hath eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed his Dominion over every Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, and though he ſits perſonally upon his Throne in Heaven, yet he rules in us by the Vice-gerency and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of his Spirit that received Commiſſion from him, and alſo by the Law of his Word enacted by it. If we underſtand it in the latter ſenſe for the <hi>Kingdom of Glory,</hi> which ſeems moſt congruous to the Deſign of the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi>
                           <pb n="233" facs="tcp:109965:131"/>
ſo alſo, <hi>we have a Kingdom,</hi> and that in a fourfold ſenſe.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, <hi>By Grace giving us the earneſt of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> it;</hi> by Faith realizing of it, by Hope embracing it, and by the Promiſes aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of it.</p>
                        <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1. Saints have a Kingdom in the firſt Fruits of it.</note> 
                           <hi>We have a Kingdom of Glory in the Earnest and firſt Fruits of it.</hi> The Comforts and Graces of the Spirit are very often in <hi>Scripture</hi> called <hi>the Earneſt of our Inheritance:</hi> So you have it in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.22. and in <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.14. Now an Earneſt you know is always part of the Bargain: So God to aſſure us that he is in earneſt when he promiſeth Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Glory to us, hath already given us part of it in the Graces of his Spirit. Grace and Glory are one and the ſame thing in a different Print, in a ſmaller and a greater Letter; here we have Heaven in ſeminal Inchoation, hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we ſhall have it in conſummate Perfection; Glory lies couched and and compacted in Grace, as the beauty of a <hi>Flower</hi> lies couched and eclipſed in the Seed; therefore the <hi>Pſalmist</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 97. <hi>That Light is ſown for the Righteous;</hi> that is,<note place="margin">Pſal. 97.</note> the Light of Joy
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:109965:132"/>
and of a future Life are in the Graces of Gods Children as in their Seed, and they ſhall certainly bud and ſprout forth into perfect Happineſs.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, <hi>We have a Kingdom of Glory,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">2. Faith rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizeth it.</note> 
                           <hi>becauſe Faith realizeth things fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and gives an exiſtence and being to things that are not.</hi> This is that Grace to which nothing is paſt nor nothing future; it contracts all things into pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent time, and makes all actually exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent; it draws Things that are at a great diſtance from it near to it ſelf; and thus the <hi>Galatians</hi> Faith repreſented the death of Chriſt ſo viſibly to them, that the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> told them, <hi>He was cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied among them,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Gal. 3.1.</note> Gal. 3.1. It dives down into the gulf of future times, and fetcheth up things that as yet are not. It is much at one to a ſtrong Faith to have Heaven or to believe it; this Grace makes Heaven as really pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent as if it were already in Poſſeſſion, and therefore it is called in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.1. <hi>The evidence of things not ſeen, and the ſubſtance of things hoped for;</hi> it is the very being of things hoped for, the being of thoſe things that as yet have no being.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="235" facs="tcp:109965:132"/>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. Hope em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braceth it.</note> 
                           <hi>We have a Kingdom as in the view of Faith, ſo alſo in the embraces of Hope.</hi> And therefore Hope is called, <hi>The Anchor of the Soul that entreth into that within the Vail,</hi> Heb. 6.19. that is,<note place="margin">Heb. 6.19.</note> into Heaven; it lays hold on all that Glory that is there laid up and kept in reverſion for us. Hope is in it ſelf a ſolid and ſubſtantial Poſſeſſion, for it ſtirs up the ſame Affections, it excites the ſame Joy, Delight and Complacency as Fruition it ſelf doth. It is the Taſter of all our Comforts, and if they be but temporal, it not only taſts them, but ſometimes quite devours them, and leaves us in ſuſpence whether it be not better to be Expectants than Enjoyers. Heavenly Hope gives the ſame real con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment and ſatisfaction that antedates our Glory and puts us into the Poſſeſſion of our Inheritance whilſt we are yet in our Nonage, only it doth not ſpend and devour its Object before Hand as earthly Hope doth.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4. God hath aſſured them of it by Promiſe</note> 
                           <hi>We have a Kingdom of Glory, becauſe God hath aſſured to us the poſſeſſion of it by his immutable word of Promiſe.</hi> And therefore it is called,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:109965:133"/>
                           <hi>Eternal Life, which God that cannot lie hath promiſed,</hi> Tit. 1.2. Gods Word is as good Security as actual Poſſeſſion. It is this Word that gives us Right and Title to it, and this Right we may well call ours. Hence we have it, and it is obſervable, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. <hi>He that believeth ſhall be ſaved.</hi> Here is aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Salvation for the future: But in <hi>John</hi> 3.18.<note place="margin">Joh. 3.18.</note> there it is, <hi>He that believeth not, is condemned already.</hi> He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth ſhall be ſaved, he that believeth not is condemned already; why Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers are no more actually condemned than Believers are actually ſaved; only what God promiſeth, or what God threatneth, it is all one whether he ſaith it is done or it ſhall be done; for Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is as ſure to the one, and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as certain to the other, as if they were already in their final Eſtate. So then <hi>we have a Kingdom,</hi> that is God, who cannot lie, hath promiſed it, and his Promiſe is as much as actual Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion it ſelf.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">The Saints Kingdom is immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veable.</note>It follows in the Text this Kingdom is deſcribed to us in the <hi>Text</hi> to be <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable, we have a Kingdom that cannot be moved;</hi> it is not like the Kingdoms
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:109965:133"/>
of the Earth, that are all ſubject to Earthquakes and Commotions, but <hi>we have a Kingdom that cannot be moved.</hi> And if we underſtand this of the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Grace</hi> in the Hearts of Believers, then the ſenſe is, it can never be ſo moved as to be utterly removed; though it be ſhaken and battered, yet the <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of God ſtandeth ſure,</hi> having this <hi>Seal</hi> on it, <hi>the Lord knoweth who are his,</hi> as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſpeaks, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19.<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2.19.</note> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed as all Earthquakes are cauſed by ſome Vapours included in the Bowels of the Earth, ſo is there enough in us to cauſe Shakings and Earthquakes, there are thoſe corrupt and ſinful ſteems of Luſts that are ſtill working and heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in our Breaſts; that were not Gods Truth, Wiſdom and Power all engaged to keep and preſerve us, we ſhould be ſoon moved from our Standing, and overthrown. If we underſtand by it the <hi>Kingdom of Glory,</hi> that is certainly immoveable, <hi>we have a Kingdom that cannot be moved;</hi> there we ſhall be free from the Temptations of <hi>Satan,</hi> from the Infirmities and Corruptions of the Fleſh, from the mutability and fickle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our own Wills, and have a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed neceſſity impoſed upon us to be for
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:109965:134"/>
ever holy, and to be for ever happy. So much for the <hi>Theſis, We have a Kingdom that cannot be moved.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> From the Theſis the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> proceeds to draw a practical Inference; wherein we may obſerve both what he exhorts us unto, and how we ought to do it. The Matter of the Duty to which he exhorts us, is, <hi>Let us have Grace whereby we may ſerve God.</hi> The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how we ought to ſerve God is ſet down in one word and that is <hi>acceptably, Let us ſerve God acceptably;</hi> which that we may do, he directs us to the means, and that is, in all our ſerving of God let us addreſs our ſelves to him, <hi>with reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and godly fear;</hi> let us ſerve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear. I ſhall only, as I paſs along, take a taſte of this part of the <hi>Text,</hi> before I fix upon what I principally intend. The Word here tranſlated <hi>reverence</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies ſhame-facedneſs or baſhfulneſs, ſuch as is commendable in Inferiours while they are in the preſence of their Superiours; and it implies in it two Things. Firſt, <hi>Conſciouſneſs of our own Vileneſs and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nworthineſs.</hi> And then it implies; Secondly, <hi>An over-awing ſenſe
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:109965:134"/>
of anothers excellency.</hi> For Modeſty or Reverence conſiſts in theſe two things, in low and debaſing Thoughts of our ſelves, and in a high Eſteem of others. Why now this the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> exhorts us to in the <hi>Text</hi> by the word Reverence; whence obſerve this, <hi>That a due ſenſe of our own vileneſs and of Gods glorious Majeſty, is an excellent qualification in all our Services to make them acceptable.</hi> Let us ſerve God acceptably, with Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and godly Fear.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Thirdly,</hi> You have in the <hi>Text</hi> the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Motive whereby the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> inforceth this Exhortation, <hi>For our God is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming Fire.</hi> Theſe Words are cited out of <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.19. where <hi>Moſes,</hi> to bring the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> from Idolatry, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents God to them as a jealous God and a conſuming Fire. And here the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> makes uſe of them to compoſe Men into a holy Awe and Reverence of God in ſerving of him: Whence ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,</p>
                        <p>Firſt, <hi>That an irreverent and fearleſs <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Worſhip of the true God, provokes him and deſerves his conſuming Wrath, as well as the Idolatrous Worſhip of a falſe God.
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:109965:135"/>
Moſes</hi> makes uſe of the ſame Words to deter the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> from Idolatry and worſhipping of a falſe God, as the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle</hi> makes uſe of to excite us to a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and worſhipping of the true God.</p>

And ſo the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> triumphs in his Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.1.</note> in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1. <hi>We know that we have an Houſe eternal in the Heavens;</hi> and yet in <hi>Verſe</hi> 11. he quickens him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the diſcharge of his Miniſterial Office, from the Fear of Gods Wrath, <hi>Knowing the Terrors of the Lord we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade Men.</hi> Though he was aſſured of Glory, yet he quickens himſelf to the diſcharge of his Miniſteral Function, by the Fear of Gods Wrath. So that it is evident there may be a Fear of Gods Wrath exciting unto Duty, where yet there is a full Aſſurance beyond all doubting and heſitation of eſcaping Wrath. So that this is not that Fear that the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> excites them that have aſſurance unto.</p>

the aſſurance that we have to eſcape <hi>Hell</hi> and <hi>Wrath</hi> is of the greateſt and moſt effectual influence to make us care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to uſe thoſe means whereby we may eſcape it. See this in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. <hi>Having theſe promiſes,</hi>

                           <hi>this may ſtrike Fear into the Hearts of thoſe that are fully aſſured of Gods love and favour to them.</hi> Such a Fear as this is, the <hi>holy Angels</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have; tho' they are ſecured by Chriſt in that bleſſed State and Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that they enjoy, yet to ſee God ſtripping and making bare his Arm, to lay on weighty ſtrokes of everlaſting Vengeance upon their Fellow <hi>Angels</hi> that are fallen, makes them to tremble and ſtand aſtoniſhed at the Almighty Power of God; and this keeps them at a due diſtance in their Thoughts and Apprehenſions of his dreadful Majeſty.

So when a Child of God, who is aſſured of the tender love and favour of God to himſelf, yet when he ſadly conſiders that Wrath and Indignation that is in God againſt the damned; when he ſees his heavenly Father angry, though it be not againſt him; yet this muſt needs ſtrike a reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rential Fear and Aw into his Soul. Now this reverential Fear will remain for ever, <hi>The Fear of the Lord endureth for
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:109965:139"/>
ever;</hi> yea, when the Children of God ſhall be made for ever happy in Heaven, yet this Fear ſhall be then encreas'd, and not at all diminiſhed; the more they ſee of the Power of the Wrath and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity of God executed upon the damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the more they fear and reverence this powerful, this Sin-revenging God; and this kind of Fear is no prejudice to their full Aſſurance and Joy, nor ſhall it be prejudicial to their compleat and perfect Happineſs in Heaven.</p>

Indeed as God hath been graciouſly pleaſed to bind himſelf in a Covenant of Grace and Mercy to you, ſo it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that this Wrath ſhould fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you; but yet ſuch a Suppoſition as this is, is enough to cauſe Fear in the moſt aſſured Heart, to think that if God had not engaged himſelf by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to deliver him from that Wrath, what then would have been his Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to all Eternity? Would not ſuch Thoughts as theſe are make you trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? Suppoſe a Man were faſt chained to the top of ſome high Rock hanging over a bottomleſs Gulf, though he knew
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:109965:140"/>
and was aſſured that he ſhould not fall into it, being immoveably faſten'd there, yet when he looks down that deep and dangerous Precipice, and fees the Gulf foaming and raging under him, will not a cold Fear drill through his Heart to think, O! if I were not here faſtned by a ſtrong Chain to this immoveable Rock, what would become of me? Even ſo Believers, you that are moſt aſſured to eſcape Hell, this is your Condition; you are faſtned to the Rock of Ages by the unchangeable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of God that will ever hold you faſt; but yet every time you look down into the bottomleſs Gulf that is under you, where thouſands are ſwallowed up to all Eternity; doth not ſuch a Thought as this is fright you to think?

cauſe Fear.

in all his ways,</hi> of <hi>multiplying his Seed as the duſt of the Earth,</hi> you would think this was no terrible Thing; and yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God reveals this Mercy to him in an awful and amazing manner, a <hi>Gap</hi> is opened in Heaven, a bright <hi>Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> reaching from Earth to Heaven; God on the top of it, <hi>Angels</hi> on every Round of it; though the Meſſage was joyful, yet the ſtrange kind of deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Meſſage makes <hi>Jacob</hi> cry out, <hi>How dreadful is this place, it is no other than the Gate of Heaven!</hi> The very Gate of Heaven becomes dreadful when it is repreſented in ſuch a Majeſtical manner.

himſelf is ſolemnized by a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> even the Sacrifice of his own Son, <hi>As a Lamb without ſpot or blemiſh;</hi> in this Blood the Treaty betwixt God and Man ſtands ratified and confirmed. Oh! dreadful Mercy, that claſps and embraces us about with Arms died red in the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt.

                        <p>Secondly, <hi>Conſider the way and method that God takes with us when he becomes our God, and that is moſt dreadful, and muſt needs make the moſt confirmed Heart to ſhake with Fear and Trembling.</hi> Indeed
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:109965:145"/>
God deals not with us in ſuch Rigour as he dealt with Jeſus Chriſt his Son; but yet uſually when he becomes our God, when he enters upon us as his Poſſeſſion; firſt, he ſhakes all the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of our Hearts, breaths in Flames of Fire into our very Marrow, cramps our Conſciences and unjoints our Souls; O the Tempeſts and Storms of Wrath that God pours into a wounded Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, when it is under ſearching Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions! O the Smart and Anguiſh of a wounded Spirit, when God inſtead of Balm ſhall only chafe it with Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone! And yet this is the common me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod that God uſeth to prepare Souls for himſelf; he ſeems to arm himſelf in all his Terrors againſt them, ſingling them out to the Conflict, and when they give up themſelves for loſt, lying gaſping for Hope ſcarcely, at length is adminiſtred ſome few reviving Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts. It is with theſe as it was with the <hi>Children of Iſrael</hi> upon <hi>Sinai,</hi> firſt they were aſtoniſhed with a confuſed noiſe of Thunder, the Air full of Lightning, the Mountains all on a Flame, and the Earth trembling under them, before they heard that comfortable Voice in <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.2. <hi>I am the Lord thy God.</hi> So
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:109965:145"/>
is it with convinced Sinners: God diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chargeth his Threatnings againſt them that ſpeak more dreadfully to them than a Voice of Thunder; he ſpeaks to them out of the midſt of Flames, and every Word ſcorcheth up their Hearts; and when they ſtand trembling and deſpairing, once at length they hear thoſe reviving Words, <hi>I am the Lord thy God.</hi> What Hearts are there now that ſuch a dreadful Mercy as this is, would not over-aw? Thoſe Diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Gods Love that break in upon the Soul in the midſt of a doleful and gloomy Night of Deſpair and Deſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, work naturally a ſweet kind of Terror and a ſhivering Joy; and that's the firſt Conſideration. The dreadful method that God takes to procure Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy for us, even by the death of his Son, and to apply Mercy to us, even by the Terrors of a convinced Conſcience, is a ſufficient Ground to affect our Hearts with Fear,<note place="margin">Reaſ. 2.

                        <p>Secondly, <hi>Though God be our God, yet to conſider that it is poſſible to loſe his Favour and the Senſe of it, this is enough to affect the Heart with a holy fear even of a

reconciled God.</hi> It is true, God's Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and Fountain Love can never be dried up, <hi>Whom he loves, he loves unto the End,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Pſal. 89.33.</note> John 1.13. <hi>And my loving Kindneſs will I never utterly take away from him,</hi> Pſal. 89.33. But yet the Streams of this Fountain Love may be very much obſtructed from flowing freely down upon us; though we ſhall never again be Children of Wrath, yet we may be Children under Wrath; every preſumptuous Sin we commit raiſeth God's diſpleaſure againſt us, he is angry with us upon every more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious and known Sin we commit; and ſince then we are in danger every Day of falling into groſs and foul Sins, and are kept only by his almighty and free Grace from the worſt, what cauſe have we to fear, leſt we forfeit his Favor and turn his Diſpleaſure againſt us? Yea again, though we ſhould be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved from Sin and continue in his Love, yet we cannot aſſure our ſelves that we ſhall continue in the Senſe and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Apprehenſion of it: Comfort is moſt arbitrary and at God's free Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, neither hath he ingaged himſelf to beſtow it upon any by any abſolute Promiſe; though now his <hi>Lamp</hi> ſhined
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:109965:146"/>
clearly upon thy <hi>Tabernacle</hi> and thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyceſt in his Smiles, yet how quickly may he wrap thee up in a dark Night of Deſertion, and turn all thy <hi>Songs</hi> into <hi>Mourning?</hi> Thou, therefore, that art now aſſured that God is thy God, fear leſt ere long thou mayeſt not think him to be ſo; certain thou art he is ſo now, yet before it be long, poſſibly, through thy Miſcarriage, thou mayeſt not think him to be ſo, and it is all one as to Comfort or Diſcomfort, whether God be thy God or not, if thou doſt not apprehend him to be ſo, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fear him.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Reaſ. 3. Why we ſhould fear God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Frown of our God touches to the quick.</note> 
                           <hi>Conſider every Frown and Stroke toucheth to the Quick, that cometh from a reconciled God and a loving Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and therefore the rather fear becauſe he is thy God.</hi> Every little Blow from a Father ſtrikes deeper and cauſeth more Smart than greater Blows from other Perſons; others ſtrike the Body, but when a loving Father ſtrikes, he wounds the Heart: So is it here; the nearneſs of the Relation betwixt God and us, puts an Anguiſh and Sting into every Correction. As the <hi>Pſalmist</hi> ſpeaks in his own Caſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 55.12.
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:109965:147"/>
                           <hi>It was not an Enemy that reproached me, neither was it he that hated me, then I could have born it; but it was thou a Friend, mine Equal, my Guide, and mine Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance.</hi> Theſe are ſad Accents; and ſo is it here: The Blood of a Sin-reveng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God may indeed break the Back, but the Blows of a gracious and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled Father break the Heart. Fear therefore, leſt through ſome Miſcarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of thine (and ſuch Miſcarriages thou art every Day guilty of) thou ſhouldeſt provoke thy God to lay ſome heavy Stroke upon thee, which will be the more ſmart from the aggravation that provoked Love puts upon it. And thus you ſee now in theſe three Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, what ground there is from the conſideration of God as our God, to enforce a holy Fear of his divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty upon our Hearts. He is our God, therefore fear him becauſe the way that he became ours is moſt dreadful; he is our God as yet, fear leſt we may not apprehend him ſo long; he is our God therefore fear him, becauſe every Stroke and Frown from a God in Covenant, comes with an aggravated ſmart and ſting.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="265" facs="tcp:109965:147"/>Why now this holy Fear, as it is no Enemy to full aſſurance, as I have ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you, ſo neither,</p>
                        <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. Holy Fear is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Love of God.</note> 
                           <hi>Is it any way prejudicial to a most ardent love of God.</hi> Filial Love and Filial Fear are two Twins; but not ſuch as <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> that ſtrive to ſupplant one another. The pure Flame of divine and heavenly Love is like other Flames, the higher it mounts the more it vibrates and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. Indeed St. <hi>John</hi> tells us,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 4.18. opened.</note> 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.18. <hi>That perfect Love caſteth out Fear.</hi> It ſhould ſeem then that all Fear of God is ſwallowed up in thoſe Hearts that are once brought into an holy Love. But the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> doth very well explain himſelf in the reaſon that he gives of this Aſſertion in the next Words, <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Love caſteth out Fear, becauſe Fear hath Torment in it.</hi> Hence therefore we may diſtinguiſh of a twofold fear of God. The one is tormenting, cauſing unquiet rollings and eſtuations in the Heart, in a ſad ſuſpenſe of what our future and eternal State may prove, and this is ſlaviſh. Now this Fear perfect Love caſteth out and expells; for where
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:109965:148"/>
divine Love is perfected in the Soul, there are no more ſuch Suſpences, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitations and Doubtings, what will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of it to Eternity. Now by <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Love</hi> may be meant, either that ſtate of Perfection to which we ſhall at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in Glory, where our whole Work to all Eternity ſhall be to love and pleaſe God, or elſe that Perfection that conſiſts in its Sincerity in this Life: If we take it for that perfection of Love that ſhall for ever burn in our Hearts when we our ſelves ſhall be made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, ſo it is certain it will caſt out all tormenting Fears; for certainly if in Heaven Hope it ſelf ſhall be aboliſhed, much more ſhall Fear be aboliſhed, for there every Saint ſhall have much more than a full aſſurance, even a full fruition of Glory, and they ſhall know them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be for ever confirmed in that bleſſed ſtate which ſhall prevent <hi>all doubts</hi> and fears. If we underſtand it of that perfection of Love that we may attain to in this Life, ſo alſo the ſtrong and vigorous actings of Love to God, caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out all tormenting Fears. It is not poſſible that that Soul that actually loves God with a vigorous and moſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Affection, ſhould at the ſame time
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:109965:148"/>
be rack'd with diſtracting fears of Hell and Damnation; for it is the ſenſe of God's Love unto the Soul that draws from it reciprocal Love again unto God. <hi>We love him,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>becauſe he first loved us.</hi> That is, as ſtrong as our apprehenſions are of God's Love to us, ſo ſtrong will our Love be in its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns to God again. Water riſeth natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally as high as its Spring; wherefore the aſſurance of God's Love being the Spring from whence our Love flows, ſuch as is our Love, ſuch will be our aſſurance alſo: If then our Love be ſtrong in its actings it muſt needs caſt out Fear, becauſe it flows from that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance with which tormenting Fear is utterly inconſiſtent. But then there is another kind of Fear that is not tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting, and that is an awful frame of Heart ſtruck with reverential appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of God's infinite Majeſty, and our own vileneſs and unworthineſs; and this perfect Love doth not caſt out, but perfects, this awful, ſedate, calm fear of God. The <hi>Angels</hi> and the glorified Saints in Heaven, whoſe Love is ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect that it can neither admit of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe or abatement, yet they ſtand in aw and fear of the terrible Majeſty of
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:109965:149"/>
the great God; the ſame infinit Excelencies of the divine Nature that attract their Love, doth alſo excite their Fear. See how the Prophet makes this an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to fear God, <hi>Jer.</hi> 10.7. <hi>Who would not fear thee, O King of Saints? For,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>in all the Earth there is none like unto thee.</hi> One would rather think Gods unparallel Excellencies and Perfections ſhould be a Motive to Love; who would not love thee, O King of Saints, ſince there is none in all the Earth like thee? Yea, but filial Fear and filial Love are of ſo near a kind and cognation, that they may well be enforced by one and the ſame Argument. <hi>Who would not fear thee? for in all the Earth there is none like thee.</hi> This is the Excellency of divine Love, it is an attractive of Love, and it is an excitement unto Fear. Well then, though we have no chilling <hi>Fear</hi> of a hot and ſcorching Hell, yet let us have an awful, reverential <hi>Fear</hi> of the glorious God, whoſe Excellencies are ſuch as cannot be matched, nor ſcarcely imitable by any in Heaven or in Earth.</p>

enables us, through divine Light beam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in upon our Conſciences, to behold him as a gracious and a reconciled Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whom before we trembled at as a ſtern and terrible Judge. The ſame Wind that in a raging Storm toſſeth the Sea too and fro in reſtleſs Heaps, in a Calm doth only gently move and fan it with pleaſing Purles. So is it here; that Spirit of God that in Conviction raiſeth a Tempeſt in the Conſcience, afterwards the ſame Spirit breaths forth a ſweet Calm of Peace and Comfort upon it: The ſame Spirit that before was a <hi>Spirit of Bondage,</hi> when the Soul is ſufficiently thereby prepared for Grace, becomes a <hi>Spirit of Adoption.</hi> This is that Spirit of Adoption that is here ſpoken of, and is called ſo, becauſe it witneſſeth with our Spirits, that we are the Children of God by Adoption. God hath but one Son by eternal Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and that is Jeſus Chriſt, called therefore, <hi>The only begotten of the Father,</hi> John 1.14. He hath many Sons by Creation, even all Mankind; ſo <hi>Adam</hi> is called <hi>The Son of God,</hi> Luke 3.38. He hath many Sons alſo by Adoption, even all that are effectually called ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the purpoſe of his Grace;
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:109965:152"/>
all that are ſanctified, who are of Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers made <hi>Heirs of God,</hi> and <hi>Co-heirs with Jeſus Chriſt</hi> himſelf, who is the natural Son of God, as it is <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.17.

It is true, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God always keeps up his convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Office in the Soul of the moſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured Saint; it convinceth them of Sin, and of Wrath due to them for Sin.<note place="margin">A two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of Sin.</note> But now there is a twofold Conviction, there is a Conviction of the Evil of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Actions, and there is a Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Evil of our State and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: Why now, though upon par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Miſcarriages of Gods Children,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:109965:153"/>
the Holy Ghoſt ſecretly ſmited their Conſciences, ſhewing them the Guilt and Evil of their Sins, thereby bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to Repentance and a godly Sorrow; yet the Holy Ghoſt never again teſtified to them, that they are in a graceleſs, unregenerate and ſinful Eſtate and Condition, and in a State of Wrath and Condemnation; it brings them to a deep Humiliation, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing them of the Evil of their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but it never brings them into legal Terrors, by convincing them of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful State; neither indeed can it be ſo, for the Spirit of God is a Spirit of Truth; and to witneſs that we are yet Children of Wrath, who are indeed the adopted Children of God, this were a falſe Teſtimony, and therefore utterly abhorred by the Spirit of God, who is a Spirit of Truth: Doth the ſame Fountain ſend forth ſweet Water and bitter?

                           </label> To this I <hi>Anſwer;</hi> It is true, it may indeed ſo happen that thoſe Saints, whoſe Joys and Comforts are at one time freſh and verdent, at another time wither and drop off, ſo that they look upon themſelves as rotten Trees, deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated to make Fuel for Hell. Whence proceeds this? It is not from the Spirit of God; but as carnal Men are apt to miſtake the firſt Work of Conviction for Melancholy or for Temptation, ſo this really proceeds from one of theſe two Cauſes. When the Children of God, after full aſſurance, come again not only to entertain Doubts of their Condition, but alſo to deſpair of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, looking on themſelves as Perſons
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:109965:154"/>
that God hath ſingled out to Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; this proceeds not from the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> but from Melancholy or Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation. Sometimes natural Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly obſtructs the ſenſe of divine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort: As it is in clear Water, when it is ſtill and tranſparent the Sun ſhines to the very bottom, but if you ſtir the Mud, preſently it grows ſo thick that no Light can pierce into it: So is it with the Children of God, though their apprehenſions of God's Love be as clear and tranſparent ſometimes as the very Air that the <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>glorified Saints</hi> breath in, in Heaven, yet if once the muddy Humor of Melancholy ſtirs, they become dark, ſo that no Light or Ray of Comfort can break in to the deſerted Soul. And then ſometimes the <hi>Devil</hi> cauſeth theſe Tragedies by his Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations, that ſo, if it were poſſible, he might drive them to Diſpair; he hated their Graces, he envies their Comforts, and therefore he would perſuade them that all their former Joys were but De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions, proud Dreams and preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Fanſies, and that they are ſtill in the <hi>Gall of Bitterneſs, and in the Bond of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity;</hi> and by ſuch Suggeſtions as theſe are, when he cannot hinder the Work
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:109965:154"/>
of Grace, he ſtrives what he can to hinder the Senſe of Comfort. When, therefore, thoſe that have once rejoyced under the comfortable Perſuaſions of God's Love to them, the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> witneſſing himſelf to them to be a <hi>Spirit of Adoption,</hi> by being in them a Spirit of Sanctification; if they now find themſelves under the Bondage of <hi>legal Fears and Terrors</hi> and ſlaviſh Dejecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, looking upon themſelves as under the revenging Wrath of God, and as Perſons devoted to Deſtruction; let them know, ſuch Fears proceed not from the Convictions of the Spirit of God, who hath been a Spirit of Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, but it proceeds from the Deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Satan; for thoſe that once receive the <hi>Spirit of Adoption,</hi> never receive the <hi>Spirit of Bondage</hi> again to fear; that is, to fear with a ſlaviſh, tormenting Fear.</p>
                        <p>Sixthly,<note place="margin">6. We ought to fear God, tho' we know him to be our God.</note> 
                           <hi>A reverential, filial Fear of God, may and ought to poſſeſs our Souls, while the Spirit of God, who is a Spirit of Adoption, is, by the cleareſt Evidences, actually witneſſing our Son-ſhip to us.</hi> Let Men boaſt what they will of their high Goſpel-attainments, yet certainly they
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:109965:155"/>
have not the genuine Diſpoſition of God's Children, whoſe Love to him is not mingled with Fear, and whoſe Fear of him is not encreaſed by their Love. Love! it is the Gage and Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of all our Affections; and according to the proportion of our Love to God, ſuch will be our Fear; that is, the more we love God, the more we ſhall fear his Diſpleaſure and the Loſs of his Favour. It is in vain for us to pretend love to God as our Father, unleſs we fear him alſo as our Lord and Maſter. Chriſt who was <hi>his only begotten Son,</hi> and certainly had much more clear aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of the love and favour of God, than any <hi>adopted Sons</hi> can poſſibly have, yet the <hi>Scripture</hi> aſcribes an holy, awful, reverential Fear of God even unto him; <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.7. <hi>When he offered up Prayers with ſtrong Cries and Tears, and was heard in that he feared;</hi> it may be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd, he was heard becauſe of his god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Fear. So in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11.2. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord ſhall reſt upon him, the Spirit of Knowledge and of the Fear of the Lord,</hi> ſpeaking of Chriſt. If therefore he feared God, who was himſelf to be feared as God equal to him and his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Son, how much more ought we
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:109965:155"/>
to fear the great God, who are, as it were, but Up-ſtarts in the Family of Heaven; we wretched and forlorn Out-caſts, that were but lately raked out of the Dunghil, and by meer Pity taken up into the Boſom of God, and nurtured as his Children? And thus you ſee the Fear of God is not in the leaſt contrary to the free Spirit of Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4. A Fear of God is no Impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to a holy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing in God.</note> 
                           <hi>An awful Fear of God is no Impediment to a holy Rejoycing.</hi> Indeed ſlaviſh Fear damps all true Joy. Thoſe that Fear and expect the Revengings of God cannot have any true Joy; they may have a kind of mad Jollity that ſpends it ſelf in Noiſe and Tumults, that may roar out Songs of Mirth, only to drown the loud Roarings of their own Conſciences. Such as theſe are like your new Liquor that works over into Foam and Froth, when the bottom is thick and troubl'd. So in this falſe Joy, the Countenance runs over with Laughter, when yet the Heart is brim full of the Wrath of God; of ſuch the wiſe Man ſpeaks, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.13.<note place="margin">Prov. 14.13.</note> 
                           <hi>Even in Laughter the Heart is ſorrowful.</hi> But now a <hi>filial fear of God,</hi> puts no check at all upon
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:109965:156"/>
our holy Rejoycing in him; ſpiritual Joy is not of that flaſhy Nature, but it is a ſober and a ſevere Grace, it is Joy mixed with Fear; and becauſe of the mixture of theſe two together, the fear of God with joy in the Lord, therefore we find theſe two are promiſcuouſly aſcribed each to other; ſo in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 60.5. <hi>Their Hearts ſhall fear and be enlarged.</hi> You know it is the property of Joy to extend and enlarge the Heart; Fear contracts and draws it together, but here Fear is ſaid to dilate the Heart, to denote to us, that a Chriſtians Fear is always conjoyned and mingled together with his Joy. And ſo on the other Hand it is ſaid,<note place="margin">Pſal. 2.11.</note> 
                           <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.11. <hi>Serve the Lord with Fear, and rejoyce with Trembling.</hi> Fear with Trembling is more proper and natural; but becauſe of the mixture of theſe two Graces in the Heart of a Chriſtian, therefore the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> thus expreſſeth it, <hi>Rejoyce with Trembling;</hi> for great Joys as well as great Fears, cauſe a kind of trembling and fluttering in the Heart: As it was with the two Women, whom the <hi>Angels</hi> aſſured of Chriſt's Reſurrection,<note place="margin">Mat. 28.8.</note> 
                           <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.8. <hi>They departed from the Sepulchre with Fear and great Joy.</hi> So is it with thoſe Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:109965:156"/>
who by the Eye of Faith looking upon the Death and into the Sepulchre of Jeſus Chriſt, are aſſured that he is riſen for their Juſtification, cannot but have their Hearts filled with a quaking and a fearful Joy: Even a Chriſtians ſtrong Praiſes are breathed out with a ſhaking and a trembling Voice; ſo that godly Fear is no Impediment to a holy and a ſevere Rejoycing in God as our Saviour.</p>
                        <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">5. Godly <hi>fear</hi> lays no check on our free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and boldneſs with God.</note> 
                           <hi>Godly Fear lays no check upon our holy freedom and boldneſs with God.</hi> God hath eſtabliſhed a Throne of Grace whereon he ſets, and unto which he invites his People to approach with a becoming Confidence, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.16. <hi>Let us come boldly to the Throne of Grace.</hi> As that <hi>Emperor</hi> counted his Clemency diſparaged when any delivered a Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to him with a ſhaking Hand, as though he doubted of his Favour; ſo God loves when we make our Addreſſes to him, that we ſhould do it with full aſſurance of Faith, nothing doubting of acceptance with him, and of an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer from him. He that asks timor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, only begs a Denial from God. But yet that this boldneſs may not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:109965:157"/>
into rudeneſs and irreverence, he requires that our Freedom with him be tempered with an awful Fear of him. We muſt come in all Humility and Proſtration of Soul, with broken Hearts and bended Knees, to touch that golden Scepter that he holds forth to us.</p>
                        <p>Thus you ſee in theſe five Things, how conſiſtent the Grace of Fear is with other Graces of the Spirit; it is no Impediment to a full Aſſurance, its no Hinderance to Love, its no Impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to a Spirit of Adoption, nor to a holy Rejoycing, no, nor to a holy Boldneſs.</p>

We are Stubble and Fuel fully prepared, our Sins have made us ſo, and for us to ſtand it out againſt God, is no other than for dried Stubble to challenge the devouring Fire. Now God, that he might not break forth upon us and deſtroy us, hath himſelf prepared a Screen to hide and ſhelter us from this flaming Wrath, and that is Chriſt the Mediator.

                           <hi>Numb.</hi> 16.48. when the rebellious <hi>Iſraelites</hi> mutined againſt <hi>Moſes,</hi> God did ſuddenly break forth upon them, and ſlew almoſt fifteen
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:109965:167"/>
hundred thouſand of them Dead upon the Place. As Fire runs on a Train of Powder, ſo did this Wrath of God paſs ſwiftly from one to another, till <hi>Aaron</hi> interpoſed and ſtopt it; there ſtood that mighty Prieſt as a Bulwark betwixt the living and the dead, and intercepted the reſt from this deſtroying Wrath; and though it overwhelmed ſo many Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, yet it could not bear down his powerful Interceſſion; he alone was the Fence and Safeguard of a periſhing People. Chriſt upon the Croſs main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the ſame Station, interpoſing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Living and the Dead; the Wrath of God conſumes all before it that is not under the Protection of that Screen, there it ſtops; and though it ſeized fiercely upon him too, yet it never burnt through him to reach thoſe that fled for Security to that Refuge ſet before them. In a general Confla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration, even Chaff and Stubble may be ſecure, under the Covert of an Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantine Wall.

<pb n="306" facs="tcp:109965:168"/>
the Wrath of God hath conſumed the one, he ſtands and keeps off the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of it from the other. Indeed there is a Wall that ſtands betwixt God and every wicked Man, but it is a Wall of Partition, as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> calls it, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.14.<note place="margin">Eph. 2.14.</note> it is a Wall that ſeparates them from the Love and Favour of God, and hides his Face from them. A Partition of dry and rotten Boards may keep off the Light and kindly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences of the Sun, but it is no Fence againſt the Rage of Fire, but rather encreaſeth and augments it. So wicked Men are ſeparated from the Love and Favour of God by their Sins, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.2. <hi>Your Iniquities have ſeparated betwixt you and your God;</hi> yea, and they keep off his cheriſhing Influences, but they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to his fiery Wrath. Why now Chriſt is a Wall of Defence, that ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates his from the Wrath and Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God. A Wall of <hi>Cryſtal</hi> is a ſafe Defence againſt the force of Fire, yet is it no obſtruction to the warm Beams and cheriſhing Light of the Sun. Such a Cryſtal Wall is Chriſt, that keeps off God's fiery Indignation from us, but yet conveys to us the cheriſhing and reviving Influences of his Love.

It is ſtrange to obſerve what a giddy Thing the Mind of Man is: As an empty Veſſel rolls too and fro, and is toſſed up and down by every Wave, never ſailing ſteadily; ſo is the vain Mind of Man driven by every fooliſh and imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Thought, till the fear of God, that

Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly if any thing be of force to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Heart into a ſober, ſerious Frame, it is the conſideration of God's great and dreadful Majeſty, the fear of which will fill us with noble and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Thoughts how we may eſcape his Wrath, and how we may ſecure to our ſelves eternal Happineſs. Theſe are important Thoughts, and they ought to be our great and only Care, that ſo we may approve our ſelves to God, and be at the laſt Day found of him in well-doing. Before the Heart is ballaſted with this Fear of God, it runs after every vagrant Thought that comes croſs us or fleets before us; as Children run after every Feather that the Wind drives. But now the Fear of God fixeth this fleetineſs, and brings the Heart to a holy conſiſtency and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity in its Thoughts: It is this Fear that united the Heart, and therefore <hi>David</hi> prays, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 86.11. <hi>

                           <pb n="311" facs="tcp:109965:170"/>Thirdly, <hi>This holy Fear of God is a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> moſt ſovereign Preſervative againſt Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie.</hi>

It is a deſign to put a ſolemn Cheat upon God. Certainly where the Fear of God over-awes the Heart, we ſhall not dare to abuſe his holy and reverend Name as Hypocrites do, in their mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mention of him. When we ſpeak of him with our Lips, but never think of him with our Hearts, this is to abuſe the holy and reverend Name of God; and it is a ſure Argument that they ſtand in no dread of God, whoſe Hearts meditate Vanity with Eyes and Hands lifted up to Heaven. Will any dare in the preſence of a Prince, while they pretend Reverence to him, to uſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Geſtures? Would not this juſtly be interpreted a Contempt of him? Why all the religious Geſtures of Hypocrites are but Antick; and while they move their Lips in Prayer, without the correſponding motion of the Heart, they do but make Mouths at God; and how can they fear him, that are thus audacious to ſcoff at him? Yea, the <hi>Scripture</hi> ſets it down as a remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable

Matter, when Hypocrites begin to fear God;<note place="margin">Iſa. 33.12.14.</note> 
                           <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33.12, 14. <hi>Hear ye and acknowledge my Might,</hi> ſays God: Why what's the matter? <hi>The Sinners in Sion are afraid, fearfulneſs hath ſurprized the Hypocrites.</hi> It is much eaſier to ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie and daunt profligate Sinners than groſs Hypocrites; becauſe Hypocrites, by often dallying with God, wear off all Senſe and Dread of God, and arrive at length to a plain contempt and ſcorn of him. If therefore you would in every Duty approve your Hearts in Sincerity unto God, nouriſh in you this holy Fear of his Majeſty. This Fear is that which makes a Chriſtian ſingle-hearted; and, as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> commands <hi>Servants,</hi>

It is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable place, that in <hi>Joſh.</hi> 24.14. <hi>Now therefore fear the Lord, and ſerve him in Sincerity.</hi> The Fear of God is of a mighty influence to Sincerity in all our Services and Performances that we

And they may be conſidered alſo as ſtanding in oppoſition to God, abuſing their Power by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding things that are unlawful, and by Perſecution endeavouring to terrifie Men from the Ways and Service of God: And ſo they may be feared with a Fear of flight and eſchewal. <hi>When ye are perſecuted in one City, flee you to another,</hi> Matth. 10.23. We may ſo

fear them as to labour to avoid their Rage, and to conſult our own Safety. But the Fear that is here forbidden is, <hi>Fear not them that can kill the Body;</hi> that is, with a diſtruſtful, perverting Fear, ſuch a Fear as cauſeth Men for the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of their temporal Life to deſert the Profeſſion and Practice of Godlineſs; with ſuch a Fear, Fear not Men. He will not, that truly fears God, thus fear Men; no, the Fear of God lays a check upon this ſinful Fear of Men, he that truly fears God will not immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately fear Men; for it is the property of holy Fear to repreſent the diſpleaſure of God, as an infinitely greater Evil than the loſs of Eſtate, Liberty, nay, of Life it ſelf, or whatever the Rage and Power of Man can either inflict or threaten, and this makes them chooſe Affliction rather than Sin. See this fearleſs Spirit in thoſe three Heroick Champions,<note place="margin">Dan. 3.16.</note>

A Man that truly fears God, reputes with himſelf, that to gain the favour of Men with the diſpleaſure of God, to redeem a temporal Life by an eternal Death, is the fooliſheſt Bargain that can be made; he knows the rage of Man is under the reſtraint of God, and that a Hair of his Head ſhall not fall to the Ground without his heavenly Father's Knowledge and Permiſſion; and if God doth ſuffer wicked Men to inflict the utmoſt that their Rage and Spight can prompt them unto, yet it reacheth only their earthly part, the dull part of Man, the Body; they may perſecute, torment and kill us, but yet they cannot hurt us; one momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tany Gripe of Hells Torments is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely more intolerable, than all the Cruelties that Men can poſſibly invent or inflict; one Frown from an angry God hath more Dread and Terror in it, than all the Rage and Threatnings of the moſt barbarous and cruel Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants; and that Chriſtian that makes

                           <pb n="360" facs="tcp:109965:195"/>I <hi>Anſwer;</hi> Sins are of two ſorts; there are Sins that are <hi>Crimes,</hi> and there are Sins that are but <hi>Faults.</hi> Crimes I call thoſe Sins that are branded for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous both by God and Man, as <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Adultery, Blaſphemy,</hi> and the like, at which even natural Conſcience re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coils, ſuch carnal Sins as affright Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and make it look pale and ghaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. A <hi>Crime</hi> I alſo call any ſin that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiated by an acceſs of Guilt by the dreadful Aggravations of being committed knowingly and wilfully. By <hi>Faults</hi> I mean Sins of daily Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity and Surreption, ſuch as do fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſurprize the beſt and the holieſt Chriſtians, from which no Man's Piety nor Watchfulneſs can ſecure him. Why, now though we be over-taken with <hi>Faults,</hi> and every Day and Hour contract new and freſh Guilt upon our Conſciences, yet we may have clear and good Conſciences while we are care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to keep our ſelves from <hi>Crimes,</hi> from all Sins that are ſo in their own Nature by the horridneſs of the Fact, and from all Sins that are made ſo by great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Circumſtances of being deliberate and wilful; while we keep our ſelves
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:109965:195"/>
from theſe we have good Conſciences, notwithſtanding Sins of ordinary Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: That Man hath a good Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence who preſerves himſelf from all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous and groſs Sins, and from all other wilful and deliberate Sins. Now this <hi>clearneſs of Conſcience</hi> is a thing poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to be attained; Men may, with care and caution, keep themſelves free from all ſelf-condemning <hi>Crimes,</hi> and live ſo evenly that when their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences are moſt peeviſh and toutchy, yet they ſhall have nothing to accuſe them of, but what is common to all Men; of ſuch Men as theſe, this we may af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that they have been able with Joy to reflect back upon their paſt Lives in a dying hour, that poſſibly never knew any Guilt by themſelves, than what the Sins of common and daily In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity hath expoſed them unto. This now is to keep good Conſciences. <hi>We live well,</hi> ſays St. <hi>Auſtin, if we live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Crimes; to live without Fault is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, and he that thinks he doth it, keeps himſelf not from Sin but from Pardon.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Secondly, <hi>Another way to keep our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> clear, is by cleanſing them when they are defiled.</hi> He keeps his Garments
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:109965:196"/>
clean that keeps himſelf from falling; and next degree, he who being fallen haſtes to cleanſe himſelf from his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted Filth: And thus, at leaſt, we may keep our Conſciences clear both from <hi>Crimes</hi> and from <hi>Faults</hi> alſo, while we labour to cleanſe them from their Defilements, and to rub out and waſh away thoſe Spots with which at any time we are occaſionally beſpatter'd. There is a twofold Blot Sin leaves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind it, there is a Blot of Diſcredit and a Blot of Defilement; the former is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delible: As the Scar remains when the Wound is healed; ſo this Blot remains upon the Soul, when the Guilt of Sin is removed. It is a Diſcredit to a <hi>Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor,</hi> though pardoned, that ever he ſhould do that which deſerv'd Death: And ſo it is a kind of Blot upon a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian's Name for ever, to have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thoſe Sins that have deſerved eternal Death, though through the free Mercy and unſpeakable Grace of God he hath obtained the Pardon of them. But then there is another Blot, a Blot of Defilement, that renders Men loathſom and deformed in the Eyes of God; and thus every Sin we commit leaves a Blot and a Stain upon the Soul; a Stain that
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:109965:196"/>
defaceth God's Image, and that defiles our own Conſciences; and when this Stain and Blot is cleanſed, then are we ſaid to have <hi>clear Conſciences,</hi> when we have taken off that Blot and Defilement that Sin hath left, whereby we are ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred deformed in the ſight of God, and whereby the Image of God is defaced upon the Soul. Thus you ſee in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral there are two ways to keep a clear Conſcience;<note place="margin">Directions for the getting and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a clear Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</note> the one by preventing its Defilement, and the other by cleanſing of it when it is defiled. Now to help you in both theſe Caſes, I ſhall lay down ſeveral Particulars.</p>
                        <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1. Get Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience rightly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</note> 
                           <hi>If you would have your Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences clear, get them rightly informed.</hi> How can Conſcience be clear, ſo long as the Fogs and thick Miſts of Ignorance and Error poſſeſs it? Labour, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to let in ſpiritual Light into it, that you may ſee how to cleanſe it. It is as much Vanity to go about to cleanſe an ignorant Conſcience, as it is in vain to ſweep a dark Room. An ignorant, conſcientious Man, that knows not the Limits of Sin and Duty, may, after a great deal of pudder with his Conſcience, leave it much worſe
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:109965:197"/>
than he found it, and caſt out Jewels inſtead of Rubbiſh: Indeed it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for an ignorant Man to have a good Conſcience, whether we reſpect Duty or Comfort; in point of Duty I have ſhewed you formerly that Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance will make Conſcience unneceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily ſcrupulous, or daringly preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: Now neither can an ignorant Conſcience be good in reſpect of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, becauſe through Ignorance Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience oftentimes quarrels at that which is a true Ground of Rejoycing. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience</hi> is that Glaſs whereby we may both view our ſelves, and alſo our Actions: Now as a Glaſs, when falſly framed, repreſents a beautiful Face monſtrous and frightful, ſo Conſcience, when falſly informed, makes even love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Actions appear miſhapen and terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, by diſtorted Repreſentations of thoſe Things that are lawful, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps our Duty alſo. Therefore in the <hi>firſt</hi> place, get an enlightned Conſcience if you would get a good Conſcience; for what ſays the wiſe Man,<note place="margin">Prov. 19.2.</note> 
                           <hi>Prov.</hi> 19.2. <hi>That the Soul be without knowledge, it is not good;</hi> or, as ſome Tranſlations have it, <hi>a Soul without knowledge is not good;</hi> it is indeed good for nothing, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:109965:197"/>
it be to make Men ſin conſcienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, and to embolden them to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the greateſt Wickedneſs in the World with Peace and Comfort. Thus, ſays our Saviour, <hi>John</hi> 16.2.<note place="margin">John 16.2</note> 
                           <hi>Whoſoever killeth you ſhall think that he doth God good Service,</hi> through the Error and Miſtake of their Conſcience. So in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.8. <hi>Had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of Glory.</hi>

                        <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1. By inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting of it to diſcern betwixt Good and Evil.</note> 
                           <hi>It gives its direction what to chooſe and what to avoid, it inſtructs it to diſcern betwixt Good and Evil.</hi> Ignorant Perſons often miſtake the one for the other, and eſchew what they ſhould fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; or if they chance to do that which is good, as it is not of great worth to do good only by chance and hazard, ſo they ſin alſo in doing good; while the Judgment is in ſuſpence, the Conſcience muſt needs be under Guilt. If I know not whether I ought to do an Action or to forbear, which way ſoever I take I am entangled in Sin, <hi>for whatſoever is not of Faith is Sin:</hi> That is, whatſoever is done with a wavering Conſcience that I know not whether it be ſinful or
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:109965:198"/>
not, that thereby becomes Sin; and whatever a Man doth doubtingly, he is damned if he doth it; <hi>He that eats doubtingly,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>is damned if he eats,</hi> Rom. 14.23.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">2. By giving it Strength to inforce us to the doing of Good, and to the avoiding of Evil.</note>Secondly, <hi>Knowledge gives the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience Strength to enforce us to the doing of that which it diſcovers to be Good, and to the Flight of that which it diſcovers to be Evil.</hi> A knowing Perſon cannot ſin ſo eaſily as an ignorant Man may, but he muſt ſtruggle and wreſtle harder, and offer more Violence by far to his own Conſcience. A Man that ſees his Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger before him will hardly be dragg'd into Precipices, whereas one that is blind is eaſily led thither ſuſpecting nothing. So here, a knowing Perſon, that ſees the Danger of Hell and Damnation before him, if he ſins it muſt be with a great deal of inward reluctancy: An enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Conſcience ſtruggles and with-holds him; and if Temptation be ſo violent as to wreſt him out of the Hand of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, how is he wrackt and torn in pieces betwixt Conſcience and Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and when Conſcience hath loſt its hold, ſtill it purſues him and follows him to his Sin and diſturbs his Pleaſure,
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:109965:198"/>
and imbitters that Sweetneſs that he thought to have found in Sin before, and never leaves its Clamors till it hath at leaſt by a hypocritical and formal Repentance, and by Engagements to be more obſerving of the Commands of Conſcience for the future, ſatisfied and appeaſed it. This force Conſcience hath when it is duly informed with Knowledge. But where Ignorance hath blinded it, it ſuffers Men quietly to ruſh upon God's Neck, and <hi>upon the thick boſſes of his Buckler;</hi> it ſees not, neither reſpects any Danger when it is even on the very brink of Hell. An ignorant Perſon is like your benighted or bewildred Traveller, which becauſe it cannot ſee its own Way before it, what is to be choſen and what is to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>I might alſo add, <hi>That an effectual Means to keep the Conſcience clear, is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to waſh it with repenting Tears:</hi> But becauſe unfeigned Confeſſion of Sin doth alſo include and ſuppoſe a penitential Frame of Heart, I ſhall not, therefore, inſiſt upon this as a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Head.</p>

This is that which fills the World with Fraud and Cozenage, with Rapine and Extortion, while all tug hard to get one from another, although they loſe their Conſciences in the Scuffle. This is that which makes Men ſo often ſhift their <hi>Sails,</hi> that they may run before every Wind that blows.

eſcape this Temptation, and they can with a holy Generouſneſs ſcorn to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute their Conſciences, and to barter their precious Souls for the Gain of any of theſe fading and periſhing Riches here below, Riches that periſh in the uſing. If therefore you would keep <hi>good Conſciences,</hi> learn to deſpiſe the Threats and Frowns, the Flatterings and Fawnings of this World; look upon it as of no great concernment to you, whatever in Adverſity or Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity can happen to you in this ſhort and frail Life.

<pb n="374" facs="tcp:109965:203"/>
a mighty Influence to ſanctifie the Heart, and to keep the Conſcience and Converſation inoffenſive, and this it doth in a moral way: For did but Men believe that Heaven is ſo unconceivably glorious, ſparkling with Light, flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Pleaſure, reſounding with Praiſes, a Place where Joy and Bliſs ever dwells, and where we ſhall dwell too in an endleſs Eternity in the Smiles and Love of God, if now but for a few ſhort Years we ſtrive to live holily; did we but as really believe theſe Things to be true and certain, as we know thoſe Things to be true and certain that we ſee with our very Eyes, what manner of Chriſtians would this force us to be in all Holineſs and Godlineſs of Converſation, cleanſing our ſelves from all Pollutions both of Fleſh and Spirit? Wherefore is it that the Promiſe of ſome temporal Reward, the hopes of ſome mean Preferment from ſome great Perſon, is of Force ſufficient to make Men obſequious to them? And yet the Promiſes that God himſelf hath made of Heaven and Glory (in compariſon of which to promiſe Crowns and Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, is but to promiſe Pebbles and Gugaws) work ſo little effect upon the
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:109965:203"/>
generality of Men, to allure them from Sin to a holy Life? Whence is it, but that Men believe not that Heaven is ſo glorious as the Scripture deſcribes it to be? Nay, indeed, if they would ſpeak their Minds, they are not yet ſure whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be a Heaven or not, it is from their Unbelief: Did Men but believe the inſupportable Wrath of God, thoſe Horrors and Torments, that Fire and Sulphur, that Stench and Darkneſs, thoſe burning Chains and thoſe fiery Whips, the Woe and Anguiſh of the Damned in Hell, which are as far from being utterable as they are from being tollerable, did they as certainly believe theſe Things, as if they believe them not they ſhall certainly feel them, would they dare ſtill to venture on to <hi>treaſure up Wrath to themſelves againſt the day of Wrath?</hi> Would they ſtill dare, by wounding their Conſciences, now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage them to their own Wounding and Smart for ever hereafter?

Think with your ſelves, what effect the Senſe and Feeling of thoſe dreadful Things would have upon ſuch a one, to make him rigorouſly conſcientious, that in nothing he provoke ſo terrible a God, or offend and irritate a revenging Conſcience, that will be ſure to repay him home ſevenfold into his own Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom; why the ſame carefulneſs and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection would it work in all of us, did we as firmly and ſtrongly believe thoſe Things to be true, as God hath evidently and clearly revealed them to be true in his Word. It is true, theſe Things we all know, and we perſuade
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:109965:204"/>
our ſelves that we do believe them. Do we not profeſs to believe that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> ſhall <hi>judge</hi> both <hi>Quick</hi> and <hi>Dead,</hi> and that all ſhall receive Rewards ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Works, thoſe that have done Well ſhall receive the Reward of eternal Life, and thoſe that have done Ill the Reward of eternal Death: Theſe Things we may indeed profeſs to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and theſe Things we may fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently repreſent to our own Thoughts; but the weak and ſmall Influence that theſe Things have to over-awe our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, evinceth clearly that this is not Faith but Fancy: It is a wavering, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evident Opinion that we have taken up, and that we call by the Name of Faith; for did we live in the Belief of theſe Truths, we ſhould no more dare to ſin againſt our Conſciences, than if we ſaw <hi>Hell</hi> flaming before theſe Eyes of ours, and knew that upon the next Sin we commit we were to be caſt into it.

Faith and Fervency, to make an humble repreſentation of our Deſires unto God for thoſe Things that are according to his Will, with ſubmiſſion to his Pleaſure, and with reference to his Honour.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This is that holy Duty of Prayer, in which, of all that belong to <hi>Religion,</hi> the Soul uſually enjoys the moſt near and ſweet Communion with God. When we are oppreſſed with Guilt, or overwhelmed with Fears and Griefs, what ſweeter Retreat than to betake our ſelves to our God, and to our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, into whoſe Boſom we may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>load all our Burdens? It is the greateſt ſolace of an afflicted Mind to lie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate before the Lord, and melt it ſelf down in holy Tears and in holy Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions at his Feet. Hence it is ſaid of <hi>Hannah,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.18. That after ſhe had poured out her Soul before God, <hi>her Countenance was no more ſad.</hi> And therefore this is not ſo much our Duty as our Privilege; it is the Happineſs of the glorious Angels in Heaven, and of the Spirits of juſt Men made perfect, that they are always near unto God in their Attendance upon him, that they are Waiters about his Throne: And
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:109965:211"/>
                           <hi>Prayer</hi> gives to us the very ſame high Privilege, and brings us into the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and before the Throne of the ſame God; only with this difference, they draw near to a Throne of Glory, and we draw near to a Throne of Grace.</p>
                        <p>Let us now take a more particular View of this excellent Duty of <hi>Prayer,</hi> according to the Deſcription given of it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">1. The effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cauſe of Prayer is the Spirit.</note>Firſt, <hi>The efficient cauſe of Prayer is the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> then we Pray when we breath out thoſe Requeſts unto God, that the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> hath breathed unto us; and therefore it is ſaid, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26. <hi>The Spirit helpeth our Infirmities,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Rom. 8.26.</note> 
                           <hi>for we know not what we ſhould pray for as we ought; but the Spirit it ſelf maketh In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion for us with Sighs and Groans that cannot be uttered.</hi> All Prayers that are not dictated by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> is but howling in God's eſteem. And though wicked Men, in their Diſtreſſes, may be very paſſionate and very vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in their Requeſts, yet they have no Promiſe that their <hi>Prayers</hi> ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with God. Sometimes indeed God
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:109965:211"/>
doth hear them, and out of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Bounty and Goodneſs grants to them thoſe temporal good Things that they crave; he that hears the <hi>young Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens</hi> when they cry, he that hears the <hi>lowing of the Oxen,</hi> ſometimes alſo hears wicked Men under their Afflictions, when they roar to him as <hi>wild Bulls in a Net,</hi> as the Prophet expreſſeth it; but yet ſuch Prayers of wicked Men tho' they are anſwered, yet they are never accepted; God accepts no Petitions but ſuch as are preſented to him through the Interceſſion of Chriſt; now Chriſt makes Interceſſion for none in Heaven, but only for ſuch in whoſe Hearts the Spirit makes Interceſſion here upon Earth; their Prayers alone aſcend up to God as ſweet Incenſe, being perfumed with that <hi>much Incenſe</hi> that Chriſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers up with the <hi>Prayers of all the Saints.</hi> God always hears and anſwers them, either in the very Thing that they pray for, or elſe in what oftentimes is far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when they ask that which will be to their own Hurt; then he anſwers them graciouſly by denying them. In <hi>James</hi> 16. the Apoſtle tells us there,<note place="margin">Jam. 5.16.</note> 
                           <hi>That the effectual fervent Prayer of a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Man availeth much.</hi> This indeed
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:109965:212"/>
may ſeem a needleſs Tautology to ſay an <hi>effectual Prayer availeth,</hi> for it is but one and the ſame thing to avail and to be effectual; but if we conſult the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, we ſhall find the Words may be tranſlated, <hi>The in-wrought Prayer;</hi> and poſſibly we may with more Congruity render it thus, <hi>The Prayer of a righteous Man wrought in him;</hi> that is to ſay, by the Spirit of God ſuch a Prayer avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth much.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, <hi>As the efficient cauſe of our Prayers is the Holy Ghoſt,<note place="margin">2.

                           <hi>Lord Jeſus, receive my Spirit;</hi> yea,<note place="margin">Acts 7.59.</note> and this Adoration is due not only to the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> of Chriſt, which was from all Eternity the ſame in Being, in Majeſty and Glory with the Father; but it is alſo due unto Chriſt as <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator,</hi> as God-Man, and ſo his humane Nature is alſo joined in the participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this high Honour, through its union to the Divine Nature: The very Angels in Heaven are commanded to adore him as God-Man, as Mediator, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.6.<note place="margin">Heb. 1.6.</note>

                           <hi>They cried to one another, holy, holy is the Lord God of Hoſts.</hi> This God is the ſame who in Verſes 10, 11. bids the Prophet

ſay to the People, <hi>Hear ye indeed but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand not, make the Heart of this Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple fat, make their Ears heavy, and ſhut their Eyes, leſt they hear with their Ears and ſee with their Eyes.</hi> This is that God whom the <hi>Seraphims</hi> adored, and this is that God that ſpake to the Prophet; and the Apoſtle quoting this very place out of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Acts 28.25.</note> tells us, <hi>Acts</hi> 28.25. that it was the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> ſpake; ſo that by comparing theſe two Places together, you ſee plainly that the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> is God, and that he is to be adored by us with the ſame Worſhip that we wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the <hi>Father,</hi> and the <hi>Son,</hi> for the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> is the <hi>Lord God of Hoſts;</hi> which St. <hi>Paul</hi> refers to the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> well ſpake the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> concerning them. Thus if we conſider God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally, each Perſon in the <hi>Trinity</hi> may well be the <hi>Object</hi> of our Prayers.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, <hi>Conſider God eſſentially, and ſo we are alſo to direct our Prayers to him.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">God eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially is to be prayed unto.</note> Now to conſider God <hi>eſſentially</hi> is to have the Eye of our Faith fixed upon his Attributes, not upon his Perſon, to conſider him when we pray to him, not as <hi>Father, Son</hi> or <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> but only as an infinitely glorious, wiſe,
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:109965:213"/>
powerful, gracious God, and the like; to look upon him as a moſt pure Eſſence whoſe Preſence is every where, whoſe Preſence and Goodneſs is over all Things; to conceive him to be an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Being altogether unconceivable, this is to conſider God <hi>eſſentially.</hi> Now this Notion of God is equally common to all the <hi>Three Perſons,</hi> and therefore this is the moſt fit and congruous way when we come to God in Prayer to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent before us his <hi>Attributes,</hi> we need not ſelect out any one <hi>Perſon</hi> in the <hi>Holy Trinity, Father, Son</hi> or <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> to direct our Prayers unto, unleſs it be in ſome Caſes wherein their particular Offices are more immediately concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but when we pray to him who is Almighty, who is All-wiſe, infinitely Holy, infinitely Juſt and Merciful, we pray at once to the whole <hi>Trinity,</hi> both to the <hi>Father, Son</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi> So when we pray according to that holy Form that Chriſt hath taught us, <hi>Our Father which art in Heaven,</hi> Father there denotes not only God the Father, the firſt Perſon in the Trinity, but it is a relative Attribute belonging equally to all the Perſons in the Trinity. God is the Father of all Men by Creation and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:109965:214"/>
and he is eſpecially the Father of the Faithful by Regeneration and Adoption: Why now as theſe Actions of Creation, Regeneration and Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption are common to the whole Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, ſo alſo is the Title of Father com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to the whole Trinity; God the firſt Perſon is indeed eminently called the Father, but that is not in reſpect of us, but in reſpect of Chriſt his only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son from all Eternity; in reſpect of us the whole Trinity <hi>is our Father which art in Heaven,</hi> and when we pray ſo, we pray both to God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghoſt, to all the Three Perſons; yea, and it may ſeem very probable that when Chriſt prayed,<note place="margin">Matth. 26.39.</note> 
                           <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.39. <hi>Father, if it be poſſible let this Cup paſs from me, nevertheleſs not my Will but thy Will be done:</hi> I ſay, it's probable this Prayer was not directed to God the Father per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally, but to the whole Trinity; for we muſt conſider that Chriſt prays here only as he was Man, and that appears by his diſtinguiſhing of his Will from, and ſubmitting it to God's Will. Why now not only God the Father but the whole Trinity was the Father of Chriſt as Man, yea, Chriſt himſelf, according
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:109965:214"/>
to his divine Nature, was the Father of his humane Nature, and therefore pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as Man, to his Father, that that <hi>Cup might paſs from him,</hi> he prayed to all the Three Perſons, both to God the Father, and to God the Son, and to God the Holy Ghoſt. And thus much for the Object to whom we muſt direct our Prayers, and that is to God only, whether conſidered perſonally or eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Obſerve alſo the Matter of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> our Prayers,<note place="margin">We muſt pray for Things that are according to the will of God. 1 John 5.4.</note> 
                           <hi>It muſt be a repreſentation of our Deſires to God for ſuch Things as are according to his Will.</hi> So we have it, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.4. <hi>If we ask any thing according to his Will, he heareth us.</hi> God's Will in beſtowing a deſired Mercy upon us is beſt known by the Promiſes that he hath made to us, which Promiſes are of two Kinds; ſome refer to temporal Bleſſings, and others refer to Grace and Glory.</p>
                        <p>Why now here <hi>Firſt, Grace and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Glory are promiſed abſolutely;</hi>
                           <note place="margin">We may pray for Grace and Glory ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely.</note> it is that we are commanded all of us to ſeek after, and therefore here can lie no mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake

                        <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. We may alſo pray for tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally.</note> 
                           <hi>To pray for outward and worldly Bleſſings is not contrary to the Will of God, for he hath promiſed to beſtow them:</hi> But then as his Promiſe is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional, if it may ſtand with our good, ſo truly alſo muſt our Prayers be condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, that God would give them to us, if it may ſtand with his Will and
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:109965:216"/>
with our Good; whatſoever we thus ask we do it according to the Will of God, and we are ſure of ſpeeding in our Requeſt, either by the obtaining of our Deſires, or by being bleſſed with a Denial; for, alas, we are blind and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant Creatures, and cannot look into the Deſigns and Drift of <hi>Providence,</hi> and ſee how God hath laid in order Good and Evil in his own purpoſe; oftentimes we miſtake Evil for Good, becauſe of the preſent appearance of Good that it hath; yea, ſo ſhort-ſight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed are we, that we can look no farther than outward and preſent appearance; but God, who ſees through the whole Series and Connexion of his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, he knows many times that thoſe Things we account and deſire as Good are really evil, and therefore it is our Wiſdom to reſign up all our Deſires to his diſpoſal, and to ſay, <hi>Lord, though ſuch temporal Enjoyments may ſeem good and deſirable to me at preſent, yet thou art infinitely wiſe, and thou knoweſt what the Conſequence and Iſſue of them will be; I beg them if they may ſtand with thy Will, and if thou ſeeſt they will be as really good for me as I ſuppoſe them now to be; if they be not ſo, I beg the Favour of a Denial.</hi>
                           <pb n="401" facs="tcp:109965:216"/>
This is the right Frame that a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ought to have upon his Heart when he comes to beg temporal Mercies of God, and whilſt he thus asks any worldly Comforts he cannot ask amiſs. It was an excellent Saying of the Satyriſt, <hi>We ask thoſe Things of God,</hi> ſays he, <hi>that pleaſe our preſent Humours and Deſires, but God gives thoſe things that are beſt and fitteſt for us;</hi> for we are dearer to him, ſaith the <hi>Heathen,</hi> than we are to our ſelves. <hi>And,</hi> ſays another very well, <hi>it is mercy in God not to hear us when we ask Things that are evil;</hi> and when he refuſeth us in ſuch Requeſts, it is that he might not circumvent us in our own Prayers; for indeed whilſt we ask raſhly and intemperately whatever we fooliſhly ſet our Hearts upon, God need take no other courſe to plague and puniſh us, than by hearing and anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of us. So much for the matter of our Prayer, <hi>it muſt be for Things that are according to God's Will.</hi>

                              </gap> Name of Chriſt.</note>Firſt, <hi>We muſt pray in the Name of Chriſt.</hi> Before the Fall Man might boldly have gone to God in his own Name, and ſpeak to him upon his own account; but ſince the great Breach made betwixt Heaven and Earth, ſince that great Quarrel and Enmity aroſe betwixt God and Man, there is no hope of Man's finding acceptance with God upon his own account, and therefore he muſt go to God in the Name of a <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator.</hi> Hence Chriſt ſaith, <hi>If ye ask any thing in my Name I will do it for you,</hi> John 14.31. Now to ask in the Name of Chriſt, is nothing elſe but in all our Addreſſes to God to plead his Merits, and to depend upon his Mediation for the obtaining of thoſe good Things that we deſire. It was truly ſaid, <hi>God hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not Sinners,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">John 9.31.</note> John 9.31. And how then can we who are Sinners, yea, the chiefeſt of Sinners, hope for audience and acceptance with him who heareth none ſuch? But yet though God hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not Sinners, yet he always heareth his Son, who is continually making In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion for Sinners; yea, and he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways heareth Sinners that come to him in the Name of his Son, and by Faith
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:109965:217"/>
tender up his Merits, through which alone they expect Favour and to prevail with God. All Things go by Favour and Friendſhip in the Court of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; if we ſtand upon our own Merits and Deſerts, we ſhall be ſhamefully diſappointed in our Expectations; no Merit takes place in Heaven but only the Merit of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and whilſt we argue that by Faith with God, we come to him in the Name of his Son.</p>
                        <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. We muſt pray in Faith. Jam. 1.6.</note> 
                           <hi>Our Prayers must be put up with Faith.</hi> James 1.6. <hi>Let him ask in Faith,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>nothing waver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for let not ſuch a Man,</hi> that is, let not ſuch a Man <hi>that wavers, think to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any good Thing of God.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Heb. 11.6.</note> So in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. <hi>He that cometh to God muſt believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of thoſe that diligently ſeek him.</hi> Faith is the Souls Hand, whereby it receives thoſe Bleſſings that God willingly beſtows. Now this is the Reaſon why though we do ſo often pray to God, yet we are ſtill ſo indigent and neceſſitous; God's Ears are not heavy, his Arms are not ſhortned, neither are his Bowels dried up; no, ſtill he hath the ſame Power,
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:109965:218"/>
the ſame Will, and the ſame Love to his Children that ever he had; but we want a Hand to receive thoſe Mercies that God hath a Heart and a Hand to give forth unto us, and that's the reaſon of our Neceſſitouſneſs, notwithſtanding we do ſo often come before God in Prayer.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">3. Prayer muſt be with Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Fervency. Rom. 12.14.</note>Thirdly, <hi>Our Prayers muſt be put up as with Faith, ſo with Fervency alſo;</hi> and therefore it is required that we ſhould be <hi>fervent in Spirit, ſerving the Lord,</hi> Rom. 12.14. and ſo the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited place, <hi>The effectual, fervent Prayer of a righteous Man availeth much.</hi> We ſhould ſtrive to kindle in our Souls a holy Flame of heavenly Affections when we come to God in Prayer. The Prayers of the Saints were typified un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the old Law by Incenſe, but now no Incenſe was to be offered up without Fire: So truly there ſhould be no Prayer offered up to God without the Fire and Flame of holy Affections and Fervency. How do you think that a dull and heavy Prayer ſhould mount up as high as Heaven? Or, that God ſhould hearken or regard what we ſpeak, when we ſcarce regard what we ſpeak
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:109965:218"/>
our ſelves? That for the manner of our Prayer.</p>
                        <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">5. The End of all our Prayers muſt be the Glory of God.</note> 
                           <hi>We muſt obſerve the End that we ought to aim at in our Prayers,</hi> and that is the Glory of God, <hi>we muſt pray for thoſe Things that we want, with ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to his Will and with reference to his Glory,</hi> that muſt be the end of our Prayers. Our Deſign in begging any thing from God, ſhould be that he may have it out of us again in his Service, and to his Honour and Glory; and whilſt we propoſe this to our ſelves we are like to ſpeed in our Requeſts. We may well hope our Prayers will be ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful when we beg Mercies not to conſume them but to husband them, that the encreaſe of all may return again to God who gave them; and can we think that God will be ſparing, when if I may ſo ſpeak with reverence, it concerns his own Gain to be liberal? Wicked and unthankful Men are but like <hi>Vapors</hi> and <hi>Exhalations</hi> drawn up out of the Earth, that do but eclipſe the <hi>Sun</hi> that raiſes them. So when God raiſeth up wicked Men by his Bounty and Goodneſs, they only ſerve to eclipſe
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:109965:219"/>
and ſtain his Glory in the World. Whereas godly Men are like Rivers, that as they receive all their Streams from the Sea, ſo they return all again into the Sea: So theſe, whatever they receive from God, they improve all for and return all again unto God. And therefore they may well hope to ſpeed who beg Mercies at the Hand of God, who intend to return all again unto the Glory of God.</p>
                        <p>So much for the Qualifications of Prayer; it muſt be made by the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Holy Ghoſt, in the Name and Mediation of Jeſus Chriſt, with Faith and Fervency, making an humble repreſentation of our Wants and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires unto God for thoſe Things that are according to his Will, with ſubmiſſion to his Pleaſure, and with reference to his Honour. And thus much for the firſt Thing, What it is to pray.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">2. What is meant by Praying without ceaſing.</note>The ſecond Thing propounded, was to ſhew you, <hi>What it is to pray without ceaſing.</hi> And this I ſhall do negatively and poſitively.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="407" facs="tcp:109965:219"/>
                           <hi>Firſt,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">1. Negative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is not to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in Prayer.</note> Negatively. <hi>To pray without ceaſing is not always to be actually engaged in this Duty of Prayer,</hi> either <hi>or ally, ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bally</hi> or <hi>mentally;</hi> it is not that all other Duties ſhall be ſwallowed up and give place unto Prayer. This was an old Error of the <hi>Meſſalians</hi> and <hi>Euchites,</hi> that began 340 Years after Chriſt, whoſe Opinion it was, becauſe here and elſewhere in Scripture we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to <hi>pray continually,</hi> and to <hi>pray always,</hi> and the like, therefore they thought the whole Work of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian was only to pray. A moſt fond and fooliſh Error; for what is the great end of Prayer, but that we may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by obtain that Grace from God that may enable us to perform other Duties of Religion and Holineſs. Certainly God doth not blow up one Duty by another; he that hath commanded us <hi>to pray without ceaſing,</hi> hath likewiſe commanded us to <hi>Hear, Read, Meditate,</hi> and the like; yea, although Prayer be ſo ſpiritual and ſo heavenly a Duty, yet we are not to neglect the Duties of our particular Callings, only that we may have the more time for Prayer. God hath divided out the Work, and
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:109965:220"/>
hath given unto every Thing its Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, in which alone it is beautiful. Prayer makes Melody in God's Ears, then only when it is well timed; when we juſtle out one Duty by another, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the ſinful omiſſion of what we ſhould perform, that which we do per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form becomes unacceptable, becauſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable: Neither can we hope that Prayer will prevail with God, that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears before him guilty of the Death and Murder (if I may ſo phraſe it) of other Duties. This therefore cannot be the meaning of it, that we ſhould do nothing but Pray.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">To pray without ceaſing, implies four Things.</note>Therefore, <hi>Secondly,</hi> Abſolutely or Poſitively, I ſhall give you a fourfold Interpretation of this Expreſſion of the Apoſtle, <hi>Pray without ceaſing.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">1. To pray conſtantly and at ſet Times and Seaſons. Gen. 8.22.</note>Firſt, <hi>That may be ſaid to be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ceaſing, that is done conſtantly and at ſet Times and Seaſons.</hi> So we have the Word uſed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 8.22. <hi>While the Earth remaineth, Seed-time and Harveſt, Cold and Heat, Summer and Winter, Day and Night ſhall not ceaſe:</hi> That is, they ſhall not ceaſe in their Courſes and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Times. So here, <hi>Pray without
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:109965:220"/>
ceaſing;</hi> that is, obſerve a conſtant courſe of Prayer at fixed and appointed Times, ſtill keeping your ſelves from any ſuperſtitious Obſervations. And thus, <hi>Exod.</hi> 29.42.<note place="margin">Exod. 29.42.</note> the daily <hi>Sacrifice</hi> is called there <hi>a continual burnt Offering;</hi> and yet it was offered up only every Morning and every Evening, and yet God accounts it a continual Offering. So here <hi>Pray continually, or without cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing;</hi> that is, keep up frequent and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Times for Prayer, without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termiſſion.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, <hi>To pray without ceaſing,<note place="margin">2. It is to pray with all vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency and importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Acts 13.5.</note> is to pray with all importunity and vehemency.</hi> So in <hi>Acts</hi> 13.5. the <hi>Church</hi> is ſaid to pray for St. <hi>Peter without ceaſing;</hi> that is, they were very earneſt and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate, and would give God no reſt until he heard them. So alſo in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable of the unjuſt Steward, which our Saviour ſpake on purpoſe to ſhew how prevalent with God Importunity is, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.1. It is ſaid,<note place="margin">Luke 18.1</note> That the Lord would teach them that they <hi>ought to Pray always;</hi> that is, that they ought to pray earneſtly and importunately, not giving over till they were heard.<note place="margin">1 Sam. 7.8.</note> So alſo 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.7, 8. the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi>
                           <pb n="410" facs="tcp:109965:221"/>
entreated <hi>Samuel</hi> not <hi>to ceaſe crying to the Lord for them;</hi> that is, that he would improve all his Intereſt at the Throne of Grace to the utmoſt in their Behalfs. So we are bid to <hi>Pray without ceaſing;</hi> that is, to be earneſt and vehement, reſolving to take no Denial at the Hands of God. But yet we muſt do other Duties alſo, though we are vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this. We may learn how to demean our ſelves in this caſe towards God, by <hi>Beggars</hi> that ſometimes come to your Doors that oftentimes bring their Work along with them, they beg importunately and yet they work be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt whiles; ſo alſo ſhould we do, we ſhould beg as importunately of God as if we depended meerly upon his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and yet betwixt whiles we ſhould work as induſtriouſly as if we were our ſelves to get our Livings with our own Hands.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">3. It is upon all Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to be ſending <hi>up</hi> Ejaculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons unto God.</note>Thirdly, <hi>To pray without ceaſing is to take all Occaſions, at every turn, to be dart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of our Souls unto God in holy Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations and Ejaculations.</hi> And this we may and ought to do when we hear or read the Word, or whatever Duty of Religion we are engaged about, yea,
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:109965:221"/>
this we may and ought to do in our worldly Employments. If your Hearts and Affections be heavenly, your Thoughts will force out a Paſſage, through the Crowd and Tumult of worldly Buſineſſes, to Heaven; <hi>Ejacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations</hi> are ſwift Meſſengers that require not much time to perform their Errands in, for there is a holy Myſtery in pointing our earthly Employments with theſe <hi>heavenly Ejaculations,</hi> as Men point their Writings ſometimes with Stops, ever now and then ſhooting up a ſhort <hi>mental Prayer</hi> unto Heaven; ſuch Pauſes as theſe are you will find to be no Impediments to your worldly Affairs. This is the way for a Chriſtian to be retired and private in the midſt of a Multitude, to turn his <hi>Shop</hi> or his <hi>Field</hi> into a <hi>Cloſet;</hi> to trade for Earth, and yet to get Heaven alſo into the Bargain. So we read of <hi>Nehemiah</hi> 2.4.<note place="margin">Nehem. 2.4.</note> That whilſt the King was diſcourſing to him of the State of <hi>Judea,</hi> it is ſaid that <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah prayed unto God;</hi> that is, he ſent up ſecret Prayers to God, which tho' they eſcaped the <hi>King's</hi> notice and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, yet were they ſo prevalent as to bow and encline his Heart.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="412" facs="tcp:109965:222"/>
                           <note place="margin">4. It is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to keep our Hearts in a praying Frame.</note>
                           <hi>Fourthly</hi> and <hi>Laſtly,</hi> There is yet ſomething more in this <hi>Praying without ceaſing,</hi> and that is this; <hi>We may then be ſaid to pray without ceaſing, when we keep our Hearts in ſuch a frame, as that we are fit at all times to vent our ſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God in Prayer.</hi> When we keep alive and cheriſh a praying Spirit, and can upon all Opportunities draw near to God with full Souls, and with quick and vigorous Affections: This is <hi>to pray without ceaſing,</hi> and this I take to be the moſt genuine, natural Senſe of the Words, and the true Scope of the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle</hi> here, to have the Habit of Prayer enclining them always freely and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to breath out their Requeſts unto God,<note place="margin">They that would maintain a praying Temper muſt be careful of Two Things.</note> and to take all Occaſions to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate themſelves before his Throne of Grace. Now thoſe that would main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain this praying Temper muſt be eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially careful of Two Things.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">1. That they immerſe not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the World.</note>Firſt, <hi>That they do not too much ingulf themſelves in the Buſineſſes and Pleaſures of this Life;</hi> for this will exceedingly damp and deaden the Heart to this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Duty; as Earth caſt upon the Fire puts it out, ſo the World, when it is
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:109965:222"/>
ſpread over the Affections, muſt needs ſtifle and extinguiſh that holy Flame that ſhould aſcend up to Heaven. How hard is it for a Man, that oppreſſeth himſelf with a heap of Buſineſſes, to raiſe his Heart unto God under all that Load? How hard is it for thoſe that let out their Hearts thus too and fro, a thouſand ways, to ſummon them in the next moment to attend upon God, with that awful and ſerious Frame that becomes all thoſe that appear before him? When we come to Prayer reak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hot out of the Affairs of this World, we find our Hearts ſubject to manifold Diſtractions and Diſcompoſures, and our Thoughts ſcattered like Bees, ſtill flying from one Flower to another, ſtill bringing ſome Intelligence from world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Objects, even then when we are about divine Employments.</p>
                        <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. That they fall into no known and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptous Sin.</note> 
                           <hi>If you would maintain a praying Temper of Soul, be careful not to fall into the commiſſion of any known, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous Sin.</hi> The Guilt of Sin lying upon the Conſcience, will exceedingly deaden the Heart to Prayer. Alas! how can we go to God with any free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Spirit? How can we call him
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:109965:223"/>
Father with any Boldneſs and Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, while we are conſcious to our ſelves that we have daringly provoked him by ſome wilful Offence? I may appeal to your own Experience in this; Do not your Conſciences fly in your Faces? Do they not take you by the Throat and even choak your Speech, while you are praying with ſome ſuch Suggeſtions as theſe? What, can I pray for the Pardon of Sin, that frequently commit that which I know to be Sin? Shall I dare to lift up unclean Hands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his pure and holy Eyes, or to ſpeak to him in Prayer, when as thoſe Sins that rancor and feſter in my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, muſt needs make my Breath unſavory and noiſome to him? Will the Lord hear ſuch Prayers? Or, if he doth hear them, will he not account them an Abomination? You now, whoſe Conſciences, thus accuſe you, do you not find ſuch Reflections as theſe to be great Deadnings to your Hearts, ſuch Damps to Duty, ſuch Clippings of the Wings of the Spirit of God and takings off of the Wheels of the Soul, ſo that it drives on but ſlowly and heavily in the performance of that Duty? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly Guilt is the greateſt Impediment
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:109965:223"/>
to Duty in the World, for it takes off from the Freeneſs and Filialneſs of our Spirits, and fills us with Diſtruſt, Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence and a ſlaviſh Fear of coming be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, rather as our Judge than as our Father. And therefore we find that as ſoon as <hi>Adam</hi> had ſinned againſt his Maker, he hides himſelf from him: Yea, and we may obſerve it in our ſelves, what a ſlaviſh dejectedneſs and deadneſs ſeizeth upon us when we come to God in Duty, after we have wronged him by any known Sin; how doth this make us come with ſuch miſgiving Fears, as if we would not have God to take notice that we were in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, making us to be continually in Pain until the Duty be done? And thus you ſee what it is to <hi>Pray without ceaſing.</hi> It is to pray conſtantly at ſet Times and Seaſons, it is to pray importunate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and vehemently, it is upon all Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to be ſending up holy Ejaculations unto God, and eſpecially to keep alive and cheriſh a praying Frame of Heart: Which whoſoever would do he muſt beware of emerging himſelf in the World, and of committing any known and preſumptuous Sin. And ſo much for the doctrinal part.</p>

moſt elegant and lofty Terms, as if the <hi>Prophet</hi> would mitigate that Dread that might well ſeize upon us, from the conſideration of the terrible Majeſty of God being ſo near us, by the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and flouriſhing of the Expreſſion, <hi>Whither ſhall I go from thy Spirit?</hi> This <hi>Queſtion</hi> doth not imply that <hi>David</hi> was indeed contriving how to make an Eſcape from God, nor pondering with himſelf in what forlorn Corner of the <hi>World</hi> he might lie obſcure, where the Preſence of God ſhould never appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend him; but this Interrogation ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for a vehement Aſſertion, <hi>Whither ſhall I go?</hi> That is, there is no Place where I can go, or where I can imagine to go, but thy Spirit, and thy Preſence will be with me. <hi>Whither ſhall I go from thy Spirit?</hi> That is, either from thee who art a Spirit, and ſo canſt pierce and penetrate me, be as truly and eſſentially in the very Bowels and Marrow of my Soul, as my Soul is inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately and eſſentially in my Body. <hi>From thy Spirit;</hi> that is, from thy Knowledge and thy Power; thy Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to detect and obſerve me, thy Power to uphold or to cruſh me. In what dark Corner or Cavern ſoever I

Now ſaith the <hi>Prophet,</hi> Though I ſhould go down to the Grave, and be covered from the ſight, and forgotten out of the mind and thoughts of Men, yet thou art there, and obſerveſt every Duſt how it molders and crumbles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way: My Body cannot be more in the Grave than thou art there. If we take
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:109965:233"/>
Hell for the place of the damned, God's preſence is there likewiſe: One would think, if from any place God would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude himſelf, it ſhould be from <hi>Hell,</hi> ſince his preſence is ſufficient to make an Heaven any where; but ſo infinite is his unlimited Being, that when the Body is in the Grave, and the Soul in Hell, yet then is God preſent, both with the Soul, and with the Body. <hi>If I make my Bed in Hell,</hi> that is, If I cover my ſelf never ſo cloſe and draw the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of the thickeſt Darkneſs round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout me; If my Body ſhould lye in the deepeſt Intrails of the Earth, and my Soul be wrapt about with a Winding-ſheet of Smoak and Flames, yet thou art there, and thy preſence would ſoon find me out, <hi>Job</hi> 26.6. <hi>Hell is naked be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and Deſtruction hath no covering.</hi> Yea, the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> tells us, 2 Theſſ. 1.9. That <hi>the Wicked in Hell ſhall be puniſhed, with everlaſting deſtruction from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Lord, and from the glory of his Power.</hi> That is, not only that their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment ſhall be to be ſeparated from the preſence of the Lord; but look how they are ſaid to be puniſhed from the glory of his Power, ſo likewiſe are they to be puniſhed from his Preſence, their
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:109965:233"/>
Deſtruction ſhall be from the Glory of his Power; that is, his Power in inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moſt dreadful Puniſhments upon them, and his Power in ſuſtaining them under thoſe Puniſhments, when with one Hand the Lord ſhall hold them up in Hell, and lift up the other as high as Heaven, to give them redoubled Strokes of everlaſting Vengeance. So likewiſe they ſhall be puniſhed from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Lord; that is, God himſelf will be preſent in <hi>Hell</hi> to torment and puniſh them, that at the very ſame time that he ſhall be a cheriſhing God in Heaven, he will be a tormenting God in Hell: becauſe in them he hath eſtabliſhed his two great Thrones, the one of his Mercy, the other of his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice. But yet poſſibly there may be found ſome neglected place here below, where God hath no ſuch concernment to be preſent in it, as he hath to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in <hi>Heaven</hi> and in <hi>Hell.</hi> Now ſaith the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> Verſe 9. <hi>If I take the Wings of the Morning, and dwell in the uttermoſt Parts of the Sea, even there ſhall thine Hand lead me, and thy Right-hand ſhall hold me. Wings of the Morning</hi> is an ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant <hi>Metaphor,</hi> and by them we may conjecture is meant the Sun-beams, called

                        <p>The firſt Poſition I ſhall lay down is this,<note place="margin">Poſition 1.</note> 
                           <hi>That God is intimately and eſſential<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in all parts and places of the World;</hi> yea, this Preſence being eſſential is alſo neceſſary, ſo that it is ſimply impoſſible that God ſhould not be whereſoever the Creature is. By the World, I mean whatſoever was at the beginning crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Power of God, the Heavens, the Air, the Earth and Sea, and all things viſible and inviſible; God is with them and in them all. There are three things briefly to be touched upon here.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="436" facs="tcp:109965:235"/>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, <hi>That God is intimately preſent with the Creatures.</hi> He paſſeth through their very Beings and Inward Parts; he is in the very Center of their Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; and this flows from the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuality of his Eſſence. From hence it is that it is impoſſible that he ſhould be excluded out of the moſt cloſe compact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Being. Bodies cannot thus enter one another, becauſe of their groſs and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Subſtances; they can only ſtand without and knock for admiſſion; they cannot enter into the ſubſtance one of another: Water, when ſucked up by a Spunge, doth not paſs into the ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial part of it, but only fills, up thoſe Caverns and hollow Pores that were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore filled with Air. The <hi>Air</hi> we breath in cannot enter into the Subſtance of our Bodies, but only into thoſe Pores and hollow Receſſes that are by Nature fitted to receive it; ſo of all other Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal Beings. But <hi>Spirits</hi> are not tied up to this Law. The Soul of Man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a Spirit, reſides not only in the empty void Spaces of the <hi>Body,</hi> but alſo in the midſt of the moſt ſolid and ſubſtantial part of it. <hi>Angels,</hi> who are a degree of Spiritual Beings above the
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:109965:235"/>
Soul, they cannot be excluded from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſent in the moſt condenſed Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; and we know not how often they are in us; we know not how often they paſs through us, nor how many of them are now preſent with us. We read of no leſs than a <hi>Legion,</hi> which is Six Thouſand, that quartered themſelves together in one poſſeſſed perſon, <hi>Mark</hi> 5.9. Then, certainly God, between whom and the <hi>Angels</hi> there is infinitely more diſtance than between <hi>Angels</hi> and Bodies, cannot poſſibly be ſhut out of any Being, but diffuſeth himſelf to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry part of his Creatures.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, <hi>God is not only intimately <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> preſent with his Creatures, becauſe as he is a Spirit he paſſeth through the moſt inmoſt part of them, but he is intimately preſent with all his Creatures at once.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is his preſence diſtinguiſhed from the preſence of <hi>Angels;</hi> they indeed paſs from one to another, and be one in another; they may poſſibly ſtretch and dilate themſelves to a great compaſs, but they cannot ſtretch themſelves to an <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitarineſs,</hi> to be in all Beings at once. If an <hi>Angel</hi> ſuddenly dart himſelf from one Point of the Heavens, through the
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:109965:236"/>
Center of the Earth, to an oppoſite Point of the Heavens, and by a motion of inſinuation, without impelling or driving the Air before him, yet he is not in Heaven and Earth at once, but when he is in one place he ceaſeth to be in another; but it is not ſo with God, for he is every-where and in all things at once for ever, therefore God tells us, <hi>Do not I fill Heaven and Earth,</hi> Jer. 23.24. He is ſo in them, as that he doth not leave any one place void or empty of himſelf, for were there any places where God were not, then it could not be properly ſaid to be filled with him.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
                           <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This Omnipreſence of God is ſimply neceſſary, not only for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving and upholding of his Creatures in their Beings and Operations, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to our very Beings; for his own Eſſence is ſimple, and he cannot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw from, nor forſake any place, or any thing with which his preſence now is. God cannot contract and leſſen him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, nor gather up his <hi>Eſſence</hi> into a narrow room and compaſs; but as he is here in this very place which we now take up, ſo he muſt and will be
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:109965:236"/>
here to all Eternity. Nor is this any imperfection, as if God were not an Infinite Perfection and Excellence, for this flows from the immutability of his Nature and Eſſence; for ſhould God remove himſelf, he were not altogether unchangeable, but <hi>with him there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther change nor ſhadow of turning,</hi> Jam. 1. What the <hi>Heathens</hi> thought of this <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſity</hi> and <hi>Omnipreſence</hi> of God, it is ſomewhat obſcure, ſome of them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined him to Heaven, and were ſo far from affirming him preſent in all things, that they thought he took no care of any thing below, as being too mean and too unworthy for God to regard. This was the Opinion of the <hi>Epicureans, Acts</hi> 17.18. Others thought indeed, that the Care and Providence of God reached to theſe ordinary things, but not his Eſſence; and the ground of their Errour was, becauſe they thought it moſt befitting the <hi>Majeſty</hi> of God, to ſit only in Heaven, a glorious and a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming place, and not to make himſelf ſo cheap and ſo common, as to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with Men and the Vile Things of the World: But this is a weak Reaſon, as I ſhall ſhew anon. Some others a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Heathens</hi> had righter Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:109965:237"/>
of this Divine Attribute; one of them, being to give a Deſcription what God was, tells us moſt admirably, <hi>God was a Sphere, whoſe Center was every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, and whoſe Circumference was no where.</hi> A raiſed apprehenſion of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature in an <hi>Heathen.</hi> And ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, being demanded what God was, made anſwer, That God is an Infinite Point, than which nothing can be ſaid more (almoſt) or truer, to declare this <hi>Omnipreſence</hi> of God. It is reported of <hi>Heraclitus</hi> the <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> when his Friend came to viſit him, being in an old rotten <hi>Hovel, Come in, come in,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>for God is here.</hi> God is in the meaneſt <hi>Cottage</hi> as well as in the ſtateli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt <hi>Palace;</hi> the pooreſt <hi>Beggar</hi> cohabits with God as well as the greateſt <hi>Princes,</hi> for God is every-where preſent and ſees all things.</p>

<pb n="442" facs="tcp:109965:238"/>
ſcattered up and down the <hi>Scripture,</hi> which I ſhall not now ſpend time to recollect: The <hi>Scripture,</hi> you ſee, owns it for a truth, That God is Infinite in his Eſſence beyond the whole World, which is one of thoſe Divine Properties which poſeth <hi>Reaſon</hi> to conceive, how it is poſſible, that ſince beyond the World there is nothing, <hi>that God ſhould exist there;</hi> but though <hi>Reaſon</hi> cannot apprehend it, yet from <hi>Reaſon,</hi> as well as from <hi>Scripture,</hi> it appears it muſt be ſo.</p>

                           <note place="margin">Poſition 3.</note>
                           <hi>As God exiſts every-where, ſo all and whole God exiſts every-where.</hi> So that all God is here, and all God is there, and all God is in every place, and in every thing: This is indeed a great and moſt unconceivable Myſtery, but yet it muſt needs be ſo, becauſe God is indiviſible and ſimple and not compounded of Parts; and therefore where-ever there is any of God's <hi>Eſſence,</hi> there is all his <hi>Eſſence,</hi> otherwiſe part of his <hi>Eſſence</hi> would be here, and part there, and part of it elſewhere, which would be utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repugnant to the ſimple and uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded Nature of God. God's Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes are his <hi>Eſſence:</hi> Now there is no
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:109965:238"/>
where, where God is, but there are all his Attributes, and therefore where God is there is all his <hi>Eſſence.</hi> He is <hi>a Spirit, moſt Wiſe, moſt Powerful, moſt Juſt,</hi> and the like, here and there, as well as in Heaven above; yea, and what is more, to the aſtoniſhment of Reaſon, than all this, God is every-where Omnipreſent, and in every place. And though it be common to all Spiritual Beings, becauſe they have no parts, to have a <hi>totality</hi> in the whole, and a <hi>totality</hi> in every part: (Indeed it is expreſſed in the <hi>Schools,</hi> that Spirits are all in the whole, and all in every part;) yet herein God hath a peculiar way of ſubſiſting from other Spirits, that not only his <hi>Eſſence</hi> alone is in every part of the World, but alſo his Preſence is in all and every part of the World: So that God is every where preſent, which is beyond the reach of our apprehenſions; yet it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly true, for God's Omnipreſence being that Attribute which belongs to him, he is preſent every-where and in all things.</p>

                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
                           <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. It may be demonſtrated, <hi>That God is Omnipreſent from his preſervation of all things in their beings.</hi> Thus God is preſent with whatſoever he preſerves, but he preſerves every thing in its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, therefore he is preſent every-where. There is required as great a Power to preſerve Creatures from falling back into their firſt nothing, as there was to make them at firſt out of nothing; for Preſervation, as the <hi>Philoſopher</hi> ſpeaks, is nothing elſe but a continued and a
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:109965:239"/>
prolonged Creation. Now he cannot create any thing at a diſtance from it, becauſe no Creature is fit to convey a Creative Action, and becauſe alſo what ever Vertue or Power is in God it is his Eſſence; therefore if he create or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve by his Power, he creates and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves immediately by his Eſſence, and ſo his Eſſence muſt be whatſoever his Operations are. But God exiſts not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the World, but infinitely beyond the World alſo, that may be demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thus:</p>

Firſt, From the <hi>Infiniteneſs of God's Nature or Eſſence.</hi> That Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which is infinite, cannot be bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or limited; but God's Nature is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, therefore it cannot be bounded; but if God were only preſent in the World and did not exiſt infinitely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond it, then his Being and Nature could not be infinite as a Spirit is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite; therefore if God ſhould be inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the World, he would alſo be but infinite as the World.</p>

                           <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. Secondly, From the <hi>Infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Perfections,</hi> we may argue thus: That which is infinitely perfect, muſt be infinitely great, but God is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely perfect; ſo that there is no Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection which we can imagine but is eminently in God, therefore he muſt be infinitely great, ſo as there can be no ſpace which we can imagine, but he muſt be preſent in it: But we can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine an infinite ſpace beyond this World, therefore God is there, becauſe there is no Perfection imaginable which God hath not. Whatever is infinitely perfect, muſt be infinitely great, as appears from this, becauſe the greater a thing is, the more perfect it is of that ſame kind, as a great piece of <hi>Gold</hi> is more excellent than a leſs; and therefore from this Perfection of God, it appears, that he is <hi>every-where,</hi> he being all Perfection.</p>

                           <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. As it is demonſtrated from God's Infiniteneſs and Perfection, ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe from his Almighty Power, God can create another World greater than this, even in that imaginary ſpace which we can conceive beyond this World; therefore certainly God is now exiſtent there.</p>
                        <p>

                           <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. <hi>God</hi>'s Omnipreſence may be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> argued from the Eternity of God. God was infinitely exiſtent before the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the World, ſince he is Eternal, and the World but Temporal; the World hath ſtood only but ſome few Thouſands of Years, and before the Creation of the World there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but God; and God exiſted eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally in himſelf; therefore, though be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond this World there be nothing, yet God will be there actually exiſting in that ſame imaginary ſpace beyond this World, as he did exiſt in an imaginary ſpace before this World was created.</p>
                        <p>Thus I have done with the Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the Confirmation of them by the rational Arguments, thoſe things that relate to the <hi>Philoſophical</hi> Part of the <hi>Text,</hi> for informing of the Judgment in the Notion of that ſtupendious At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute of God's Omnipreſence.</p>

                        <p>God is a Spirit, and is not capable of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> any pollution or defilement from any vile or filthy things. The <hi>Sun-beams</hi> are no more tainted by ſhining on a Dunghil, than they are by ſhining on a Bed of Spices; no more can God be ſullied by being preſent in filthy Sinks, (to ſpeak with Reverence) than to be in the glorious Heavens, becauſe he is a Spirit, and his Eſſence is not ſubject to any taints from the Creature.</p>

                                 <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> Firſt, <hi>Is God thus infinitely preſent every-where, and thus in and with all his Creatures, then what an Encouragement is here unto Prayer?</hi> Thou canſt not ſay, Alas! I now pray, but how ſhall God hear? He is in Heaven above, and I am on Earth below, many Thouſands of Miles diſtant from his preſence: How then ſhall my weak Whiſperings, that can ſcarce reach the Walls of mine own Cloſet, ever be able to reach his Ear? No, God's Eſſential Preſence is with thee whereſoever thou art, as he is in Heaven it ſelf; and God is all Ear, he can underſtand the ſilent Motions of thy Lips every-where, yea, he can under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the ſecret Motions of thy Heart. When <hi>Hannah</hi> prayed for her Son <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel, Eli,</hi> the Prieſt of God, thought her Geſture did proceed from a diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered Head, and not from an holy Heart; but God was preſent with her Lips, and that Prayer which was thought by the Prieſt of God to be but a dumb ſhew, yet to God himſelf it was powerful Rhetorick and as loud as Thunder in his Ears. The <hi>Scripture</hi>
                              <pb n="453" facs="tcp:109965:243"/>
generally intimates that all our Prayers ſhall be directed to God in Heaven. So <hi>Solomon</hi> prayed, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.32. <hi>Then hear thou in Heaven,</hi> &amp;c. And it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain expreſſed in the 30th Verſe. So that moſt excellent Compoſure which Chriſt taught his Diſciples in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it, <hi>Our Father, which art in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> it gives our thoughts a Lift to Heaven. Now this doth not imply, that God doth no where hear our Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, but only in Heaven. But how then? Why is this Phraſe uſed? For theſe two Reaſons:</p>
                           <p>Firſt, Becauſe Heaven is the moſt glorious place; there God eſpecially hath eſtabliſhed his Throne of Grace, and ſits upon it. Now, becauſe it is moſt Glorious and Majeſtick, and ſince <hi>God</hi> is there to hear Suits and receive Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that are tendred up by all his Servants here on Earth, therefore the <hi>Scripture</hi> directeth us to that moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and celeſtial place, <hi>Hear thou in Heaven.</hi> Hence we have that Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.4. <hi>Thy Prayers and thine Alms are come up for a Memorial before God.</hi> Certainly, if our Prayers ſhould not be heard till they come to Heaven,
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:109965:244"/>
they are ſo weak and faint, that they would be out of breath by the way, and not be able then to ſpeak for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: But yet God ſpeaks in us by his Spirit, and keeps alive the Senſe of his Majeſty upon our Hearts, that he would not have us think it to be a mean and trivial thing to have our Prayers heard; therefore he repreſents himſelf to us Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rayed in all his Glory.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, Our Prayers are directed to God in Heaven, becauſe though he hears them where-ever they be uttered yet he no where hears them with ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation but in Heaven only. Our Prayers are accepted by God becauſe they are heard in Heaven. Thy Prayers are not accepted by God becauſe God hears them upon Earth, as they are heard in thy <hi>Cloſet,</hi> or as they are heard in thy Heart, but only as they are heard in Heaven; and the reaſon is, becauſe that Prayers are acceptable only as they are preſented before God in the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Interceſſion of Jeſus Chriſt. He muſt mingle them with the Incenſe of his Merits, before they can aſcend up before God as a ſweet Savour. Now Chriſt performs his <hi>Mediatory Office</hi> no
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:109965:244"/>
where but in Heaven; for though, as God, he be every-where preſent, as the <hi>Father</hi> is, and therefore hears your Prayers whereſoever they be put up; yet, as <hi>Mediator,</hi> they are only heard in Heaven by him; and he hears no Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, but the Prayers of his People, as he is <hi>Mediator;</hi> and therefore it is no comfort, to you, that Chriſt hears your Prayers, as he is God only, for ſo he doth, and cannot but do it, unleſs he hears your Prayers likewiſe as he is <hi>Mediator.</hi> Now Chriſt, as he is <hi>Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi> he is God-man, for as he wrought out our Salvation in both Natures, ſo he ſtill continues to mediate for us in both Natures: And ſince the Human Nature is only in Heaven, therefore it follows, he performs the Mediatory Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice only in Heaven. Now it is the Mediatorſhip of Chriſt alone that makes all our Prayers and Duties acceptable to God himſelf, therefore it concerns us ſtill to pray, <hi>Lord, hear us in Heaven.</hi> It is in vain that thou heareſt me on Earth, unleſs thou heareſt in Heaven too. My Prayers cannot be heard ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptably, unleſs thou heareſt them twice; thou heareſt my Prayers on Earth; not a Word of my Tongue but thou hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt;
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:109965:245"/>
but what will it avail thy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, unleſs thou heareſt my Prayers a ſecond time repeated over to thee in the Interceſſion and Mediation of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt in Heaven? And therefore, ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.34. <hi>Hear thou in Heaven, and forgive.</hi> When God ſhall only hear on Earth, he will be ſo far from forgiving, that he will be aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; but when he hears our Prayers in Heaven, through the Mediation of Chriſt, then he is inclined to forgive and pardon us. Hence we find, that the Jews prayed towards the <hi>Temple,</hi> which was a Type of Heaven, and the <hi>Altar</hi> and <hi>Incenſe</hi> and <hi>Mercy-ſeat</hi> in this <hi>Temple</hi> were Types of Chriſt, who is now in Heaven. And therefore <hi>Daniel,</hi> when in <hi>Babilon, he prayed, his Window being open towards Jeruſalem,</hi> towards the <hi>Temple;</hi> as if no Prayer were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God, but what was heard in Heaven. So <hi>Jonah,</hi> when he was in the Belly of the <hi>Whale, Jonah</hi> 2.7. <hi>My Prayer came in unto thee, into thine Holy Temple. Jonah</hi> was a ſtrong Orator when he was in the ſlimy Paunch of the Whale; yea, but God was there, and God heard him there; but yet his Prayer would have been as filthy as his
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:109965:245"/>
Perſon, if God had not heard him elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where than in the Belly of the Whale. <hi>My Prayer came in unto thee, into thine Holy Temple.</hi> That is, God heard him in Heaven. And therefore, though the Breath of <hi>Jonah</hi> could have no ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, yet the Prayer that he breathed forth, came up as Incenſe and a ſweet Perfume before God as it came into the Holy Temple. Thus God hears the Prayers of his in Heaven; but the Prayers of the wicked he hears only up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth; he hears them when they ſpeak them, but God never hears their Prayers in the Mediation of Chriſt; but the Prayers of his own People he hears on Earth, as he is an omnipreſent and omnipotent God; and he hears them in Heaven as he is a gracious and reconciled Father. If thou doſt but Whiſper thy Prayer, God will hear it; that which is but whiſpered on Earth, it rings and eccho's in the Court of Heaven; and if Chriſt ſpeaks your Prayers over to God, they become ſo loud, that God cannot ſtop his Ears againſt them. The Voice of Prayer is not like other Voices, the further they reach the weaker they grow; no, that Voice which is ſo weak that it cannot
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:109965:246"/>
be heard beyond the compaſs of thy <hi>Cloſet,</hi> yet when it is put forth in Prayer, it fills all Heaven with its ſound. But where is the encouragement unto Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in all this? If thou doſt belong to God, thou may'ſt have great encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to Prayer from the Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his <hi>Omnipreſence;</hi> for becauſe of this there is no Prayer of a Child of God but ſhall be heard in Heaven tho' it be uttered in ſecret: For conſider, that tho' Chriſt, as Man, is only in Heaven, yet Chriſt, as God, is every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where preſent, and hears the Prayers of all Men in the World. Thoſe that are wicked he regards no further, but gives them the hearing; but for his own, he regards their Prayers, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents what he hears from them to God in Heaven; Chriſt makes his Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and Omnipreſence to be ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient to the Work of his Mediatorſhip: One of his Offices is to be a faithful High-Prieſt and an Advocate to God for us; and Chriſt being ſuch an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate, that hears all the Suits and all the Cauſes of his Clients, we may be aſſured, that there is not one Prayer that God hears on Earth from us, but he hears it alſo in Heaven, through
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:109965:246"/>
Chriſt. It was a notable Scoff of <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah</hi> to <hi>Baal</hi>'s Prieſts, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.27. <hi>Cry aloud, for he is a God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture he ſleepeth and muſt be waked.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, You ſerve an unworthy God, that cannot hear thoſe that pray unto him. And indeed how ſhould he do ſo, that is not Omnipreſent? <hi>He is talking,</hi> or <hi>he is purſuing,</hi> or <hi>travelling; Cry! Cry aloud!</hi> and, peradventure, if he ſleepeth, that will awaken him. But though you ſhould cry never ſo loud, though your Cry ſhould reach from Earth to Heaven, he would be ſilent; ſuch a God as yours could never hear. And therefore when <hi>Elijah</hi> himſelf came to pray, <hi>Verſe</hi> 36. the Text doth not tell us he cried aloud, but that he came neer. But when <hi>Baal</hi>'s <hi>Prieſts</hi> roared and howled, like diſtracted Men, and cut themſelves in an idolatrous manner, <hi>Baal</hi> is not prevailed with to hear them. Now, <hi>Elijah came near;</hi> that is, he came in a calm and ſedate manner, and pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out his fervent compoſure to God, as knowing, that that God whom he prayed to, <hi>is preſent every-where.</hi> The Voice in Prayer is neceſſary upon a threefold Account:</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="460" facs="tcp:109965:247"/>
                              <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, As it is that which God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires ſhould be imployed in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, for this is the great end why our Tongues were given to us, that by them we might bleſs and ſerve God, <hi>James</hi> 3.9.</p>
                           <p>
                              <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, When in private it may be a Help and Means to raiſe up our own Affections and Devotions, then the Voice is requiſite, keeping it ſtill within the bounds of decency or privacy.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, In our joyning alſo with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> others, it is a help likewiſe to raiſe and quicken their Affections; otherwiſe, were it not for theſe three Reaſons, the Voice is no more neceſſary to make known our Wants to God, than it is to make them known to our own Hearts; for God is always in us and with us, and knows what we have need of before we ask it.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, As the Conſideration of <label type="milestone">
                                 <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> of God's Omnipreſence ſhould encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage us in Prayer, as knowing that God certainly hears us, ſo it ſhould af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect us with a Holy Awe and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:109965:247"/>
of God in all our Prayers and Duties, and in the whole Courſe of our Lives and Converſations. Certainly it is an excellent Meditation to prepare our Hearts to Duty, and to compoſe them in Duty, to be much pondering the <hi>Omnipreſence</hi> of God, to think that I am with God, he is preſent in the Room with me, even in the Congregation with me, and likewiſe in my Cloſet, and in all my Converſe and Dealings in the World: How can it be poſſible for that Man to be frothy and vain, that keeps this Thought alive in his Heart? If the Preſence of ſome Earthly Perſon ſtrike an Awe in our Hearts when we come before them, how much more ſhould the Conſideration of God's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence affect us with an Holy Fear? Suppoſe an <hi>Angel</hi> ſhould fly in the midſt of us, that are here preſent, with a ruſhing and dazling Glory, how would it make all our Hearts beat and throb within us? It would make us ſoon abandon all thoſe vain Thoughts that now we feed upon, thoſe Thoughts that eat out the Heart and Life of Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; how much more ſhould it affect us and fill us with Holy Fear, that God is now and always in the midſt of us,
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:109965:248"/>
whoſe Glory ſtains and ſullies the Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and extinguiſhes the Light of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels. Oh! that God, that is always pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with us, ſhould be worſhipped and ſerved with a Holy Fear, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred with the greateſt Veneration. Now, to imprint this the more deeply, I ſhall ſuggeſt two or three Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
                           <p>
                              <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, <hi>Becauſe God is in all things, therefore he ſees and knows all things.</hi> The Omniſcience of God is grounded upon his Omnipreſence, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.24. <hi>Can any hide himſelf in ſecret places, that I ſhall not ſee him, ſaith the Lord; do not I fill Heaven and Earth, ſaith the Lord?</hi> Nothing in Heaven or Earth can be hid or concealed from God's Eye, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.13. <hi>All things are naked and opened be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord.</hi> There is no Corner ſo retired, ſo ſhady, ſo dark, no Gulph ſo deep, that can hide any thing from the piercing diſcovery of his Eye: He knows our Thoughts, thoſe Nimble and thoſe Spiritual Things, that are ſo quick in their flight that they cannot be ſeized upon by any Creature in the World; God knows them, the Devil cannot know them, nor can an Angel
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:109965:248"/>
know them; yet God diſcerns our Thoughts more clearly than we can diſcern the Faces of one another; he ſees <hi>our Thoughts afar off,</hi> as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> tells us; he ſees our Thoughts in their firſt Conception, when they firſt begin to heave in our Breaſts; he knows the leaſt Windings and Turnings of our Souls. Now would not this compoſe us to an habitual and holy Awe of God, to be continually thinking that whatſoever we do, God's Eye is now upon us? Let every one ſay within himſelf, Where-ever I am, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I do, I am in the Preſence of the Holy God, who takes notice of all my Carriages; there is not a Glance of mine Eye, but his Eye obſerves it; there is not an irreverent or unſeemly Geſture, but he takes notice of it; there is not a Thought of mine can eſcape, but he knows that Thought; and <hi>he knows my Down-lying and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>p-ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,</hi> &amp;c. Let this Conſideration ſeaſon your Lives and Converſations; be ſtill pondering in your Minds, That what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever you are doing, his Eye is upon you, and he is preſent with you.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="464" facs="tcp:109965:249"/>
                              <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, <hi>Conſider, That God not only ſees into all you do, but he ſees it to that very end that he may examine and ſearch into it.</hi> He doth not only behold you with a common and indifferent Look, but with a ſearching, watchful and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitive Eye; he pries into the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, the Motives, the Ends of all your Actions. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 11.4. it is ſaid, <hi>The Lord's Throne is in Heaven; his Eyes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, his Eye-lids try the Children of Men. Rev.</hi> 1.14. where Chriſt is deſcribed, it is ſaid, <hi>His Eyes are as a Flame of Fire.</hi> You know the Property of Fire is to ſearch and make trial of thoſe things that are expoſed unto it, and to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the Droſs from the pure Metal: So God's Eye is like Fire, to try and examine the Actions of Men; he knows and diſcerns how much your very pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt Duties have in them of mixture and baſe ends of Formality, Hypocriſie, Diſtractedneſs and Deadneſs; he ſees through all your Specious Pretences, that which you caſt as a Miſt before the Eyes of Men, when yet thou art but a Juggler in Religion; all your Tricks and Sleights of Outward Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, all thoſe things that you uſe
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:109965:249"/>
to cozen and delude Men withal, they cannot poſſibly impoſe upon him; he is a God that can look through all thoſe Fig-leaves of Outward Profeſſion, and diſcern the Nakedneſs of your Duties through them. In the laſt place,</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, <hi>God tries all your Caſes and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Actions, in order to an Eternal Judgment and Sentence to be paſſed upon them.</hi> This Conſideration might damp the ſtouteſt Sinner's Heart in the whole World. Believe it, Sirs, God doth not only ſee your ways, but he ſees them ſo as to remember them againſt you another day; though you have forgot what you have thought and what you have ſpoken, and what you have done, yet God for ever remembers them, and at that day he will ſadly recall all theſe things again to your remembrance. Oh! that therefore this might prevail with you ſo to do every thing, as being now already under the Eye of God, and ſhortly muſt be under his Doom and Sentence. Now if God ſhould ſend an Angel to ſtand at our Backs, and tell us whatever we are doing, this Action of ours we muſt be judged for; it ſhould make us fearful of ſinning, as
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:109965:250"/>
that Angel himſelf. True, we have no ſuch Monitor, but our Conſcience performs to us the ſame Office: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore charge it upon your Conſciences, that they ſtill put you in mind of God; that he ſees you; that he will judge you; and that he always looks upon you, and writes down in thoſe Eternal Leaves of his Memorial-Book, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever proceeds from you, either in Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Religion, or the Actions of your Ordinary Courſe and Converſation: Therefore, becauſe he is Omnipreſent and ſees all things, ſtand in awe of his Omniſciency, whereby he ſees whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we do, and whereby he will try and judge us at the laſt day.</p>
